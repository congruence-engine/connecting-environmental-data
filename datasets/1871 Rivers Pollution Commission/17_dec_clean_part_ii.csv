Henderson & Company,Carpet Manufacturers,"Black Lane, Durham","Our works are situated on the river Wear. Employ 500 hands. Rateable value of works, 729l. The bed of the river has silted up very much in the districts above Bishop Auckland and Walsingham owing to refuse poured in from works and lead mines. Thirty years ago the river opposite our works was pure; now it is very filthy, especially in droughty weather. It is polluted by lead mines, town sewage, refuse from collieries, paper mills, and other works to a serious extent. Obtain supply of water jointly from river, and from waterworks; and consume yearly about 4,000,000 gallons. If the river from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us; without stating precisely we should say at least from 300l. to 400l. yearly. We manufacture yearly 500 tons of goods, of the value of 10,000l. Produce yearly 2,745,000 gallons from dyeing, and 255,000 gallons as soapuds. This refuse flows into depositing tanks, rendered clear by us to the value of 200l., and from thence into the river. We use yearly 210,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly vegetable and a little mineral, also cochineal. The spent dye stuffs are carted away to a rubbish heap. Use yearly as bleaching materials 30 cwt. of sulphur in a solid state. This is evaporated. Use yearly 4,500 gallons of olive and whale oil, of the value of 950l. to 1,000l. Produce yearly 16 tons of waste wool in carding, which is sold to farmers for manure. Use yearly, soap 22 tons; alkali 25 tons; also urine from our workpeople, and a further unknown quantity from the town. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam and water as power: steam 70, water 40, nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 3,500 tons of coal. Make 675 tons of ashes, which are carted away for the repair of neighboring roads and to ash heaps. The excrements of our workplace are discharged into the river through sewers. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all manufacturers and owners of mines (perhaps except lead mines which require further consideration) be compelled to filter all impure water issuing from their premises, and that the sewage be not allowed to enter the stream. For the proper conservancy of rivers and streams, we suggest that a public prosecutor be appointed."
Thomas Summers,Tanner,"Giles Gate, Durham","My tanyard is situated on the river Wear. Employ 10 hands. Rateable value of tanyard 45l.

It is polluted by works above, and by mines. Obtain supply of water from a spring, and from waterworks. Consume yearly about 330,000 gallons. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, I could use the water therein for that, and the direct money value to me would be worth £26. a year. I tan yearly 100 tons of hides; and make 50 tons of leather. Use yearly, lime 15 tons, bark 250 bushels, oil and tallow 5 tons. Obtain yearly 5 tons of hair in the process of depilation, which are sold to plasterers. Obtain yearly 1 ton of fleshings, which is sold to glue makers. I have 110 tan pits, varying from 4 feet to 7 feet in length and width, and 4 feet in depth. Do not use any dye wares. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my tanyard flows into sewers, and thence into the river. Use steam, 8 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 50 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of my workpeople are mixed with horse dung and used for manure. I suggest for the conservancy of rivers and streams that proper inspectors should be appointed."

Employ 550 hands. Rateable value of works, 1,330l. The bed of the river has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. There is no noticeable change in the condition of the river opposite Railway Mill, where it enters the town. The river is reasonably clean; it is not so good as Priestgate Mill, and worse at Low Mill, where it leaves the town. The river is polluted by Dye Works above, but not by mines. We obtain a supply of water partly from the Corporation; and consume about 9,000,000 gallons yearly. If the Skerne water were as pure as the water supplied by the Corporation, it would serve the same purpose for the latter, 50l. a year; but no amount of cleansing would effect this, as the water naturally contains much earthy matter.

The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The floods and also the small volume of water flowing down the stream are caused by the increased agricultural drainage of the upper portion of the watershed. The river is not polluted by works above, nor by mines.

Use both steam and water as power steam, 30 horse, and water 80 nominal horse power. Consume, yearly, coal 1,100 tons, and make about 90 tons of ashes, which are used for filling up hollow places, and repairing the roads. The excrements of our workpeople are regularly removed away from the premises by farmers, and used for manure. We would suggest as best means of avoiding pollution in future, to provide for a constant flow of water down the river channel; that a reservoir or reservoirs should be formed at the head of each main stream to impound the flood water. The cost of the land and works and the expense of maintenance should be defrayed by a rate on all landed property within the watershed, and also on all mill and other property on the banks of the streams. Riparian owners have benefited by their land being drained, and this is carried out to a very great extent in this neighbourhood, so much that the present volume of the water in the streams has greatly decreased, and in summer time there is scarcely any water in the stream. The millowners and manufacturers would also be greatly benefited by the construction of such reservoirs, as they would have an ample and constant supply of water furnished to their works."

"Whitwell, Busher And Company",Worsted Spinners,"Beck Mill, Kendal","Our works are situated on the Mint, a tributary of the Kent. Employ 9 hands. Rateable value of works, 50l. Our works are not affected by floods. The river is broad and the fall good opposite our mill, and any temporary silting up of the bed is immediately washed away in flood time. The stream is only slightly polluted by the works of Messrs. Braithwaite situated above ours, and is not polluted by mines. Obtain our supply of water from the stream, and consume yearly about 25,000 gallons for heating the steam boiler, and for scouring the worsted. Manufacture yearly 20,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 3,500l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the mill race, and thence into the river. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly Gallipoli oil 10 gallons, and soap 3 cwt. Use water as power, 15 nominal horse-power. Use yearly about 9 tons of coal, the ashes from which are mixed with the excrements of our workpeople, which are carted away from the works. Have no suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams, but we believe that the subject is a very important one and deserves the best attention of all practically acquainted with it."
Whitwell & Company,Carpet Manufacturers,"Dockray Hall Mills, Kendal","Our works are situated on the river Kent. Employ 237 hands. Rateable value of works, 412l. The bed of the stream has silted up slightly, caused by weirs erected across the stream to supply water to the dye houses. Our works are affected to a small extent by floods.The river is generally clear opposite our works ; and probably more so since the river wall was built, which increases the velocity of the current. The river is slightly polluted by a paper mill and a woollen mill above, but before the water reaches our works it is comparatively clear, except in flood time; it is then turbid. The river is not polluted by mines. Obtain our supply of water principally from river, and a small quantity from the waterworks; and consume yearly in dyeing and for steam-engine purposes 1,588,000 gallons. We are unable to state the volume we use for washing. The water of the river is sufficiently clear for our business purposes. As the goods are woven at other works, not near the river, we only give the weight and approximate value of the yarn dyed and finished, which is as follows: linen 650 lbs., value 27l.; woollen 2,460 lbs., value 13,835l., worsted yarn 78,120 lbs., value 7,165l. We produce yearly liquid refuse from dyeing 560,000 gallons, and from spools 2,500 gallons. We have sometimes used depositing buckets, but not now. We do not filter the waste liquid, but it flows direct into the river. Use yearly as dye wares logwood, cochineal, and fustic. The dye stuffs are used for filling up hollow places on our land. We do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 16 tons of Price's and other oils of the value of 600l. We produce yearly about 30 tons of waste wool In the process of carding, which are sold to manure manufacturers. Use yearly, soap 8,178 lbs., and alkali 34,164 lbs. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use both steam and water as power, steam 25, and water 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 470 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair roads for filling up hollow places. The excrements of our workplace are partially used for manure, and are partially thrown into the river. With the exception of the excrement of our workpeople we do not think that the refuse from our works pollutes the river. As manufacturing works do in the aggregate pollute rivers, we suppose that the best means of avoiding pollution in future would be that all solid matters should be kept out and the liquid refuse should be filtered before being passed in. Where there is a local board of health, we think that the entire conservancy of rivers and streams should be in their hands for all purposes; where no local board of health exists, the guardians of the unions (who have already charge and management of streets and dwelling houses) should in our opinion constitute the conservancy board."
"John, J. & William Wilson",Manufacturing,"Castle Mills, Kendal","Our works are situated on the river Kent. Employ 360 hands. Rateable value of works, 679l. The bed of the stream has silted up certain places, caused by d‚àö©bris brought down by floods. Our works are not affected by floods, as we rarely remove the silt and obstructions formed at the head of our mill race. There has been little change, if any, in the condition of the river within our knowledge. The river is polluted by works above, but not to a very considerable extent; it is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water chiefly from the river, and partially from the waterworks, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. The river is sufficiently clear for our purposes, and we do not think it could be improved. Manufacture yearly 450,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 55,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 12,000,000 gallons, dyeing 600,000 gallons, and from soapsuds 80,000 gallons. We have depositing tanks for the soapsuds. The other waste liquid flows direct into the river, but sewers are now in course of construction, and the liquid refuse from our works will be then intercepted and carried of the sewage to the town on to land below the town to be there utilized. Use yearly as dye wares, cochineal, logwood, chromate of potash, indigo, and aniline colours. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 30 tons of Price's, coal and Gallipoli oil. Produce yearly 41 tons of waste in the process of carding, which are sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 65, soapsuds 1, ammonia 1Œ© tons, and urine 400 gallons. Use both steam and water as power steam 30 and water 30 nominal horse power. Consume yearly about 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away by the authorities of the town, to be used in repairing roads. The excrements of our work people are applied for manure, and partly turned into the river. We are of opinion that when the sewers, now in course of construction, are completed, the river will be practically clear. We are of opinion that all persons should be prevented from polluting streams, but at the same time we believe that any attempt to maintain a high state of purity in a manufacturing county will entirely fail, and destroy an immense source of wealth, the result of manufacturing industry."
Braithwaite & Company,Dyers,"Highgate, Kendal","Our works are situated on the Kent. Employ 17 men. Rateable value of works, 68l. 15s. The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The bed of the stream has been much improved of late, the course having been made feet wider, and the bed lowered at least six inches. The river is polluted by works above, and especially by the sewage of the town; but works are now in progress for intercepting the sewage on to land below the town. The bed of the river is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water principally from the river, and only occasionally from the waterworks; consume yearly at our works, 10,000,000 gallons. When there is an ample volume of water in the river, the water is sufficiently pure for all our purposes. We give yearly 300,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 30,000l. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing 9,500,000 gallons, from dyeing 400,000 gallons, from soapsuds 100,000 gallons. The whole of the liquid refuse, except soapsuds, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly as dyes, ware dyes woods 179,200 lbs., indigo and cochineal 2,400 lbs., mordants, and copperas 6,720 lbs. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials or oil. Use yearly, soap 5,236 lbs., alkali. 40,320 lbs. and urine 15,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, but as the works for carrying out this process have been so recently erected, we are not able to state the amount we gain by the extraction of the grease. Power: Consume yearly 530 tons of coal; use 30 tons of ash; we pay for their being carted away from our premises. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away for manure. The main sewer for the town now in course of construction passes our works, and will convey the whole of the waste liquids therefrom. The irregular volume of water flowing down the stream in summer is the greatest evil we have to contend with. A constant daily supply of water would be the best means of preserving the purity of the stream. For the remainder of the suggestions upon this point we refer to our evidence (page 86) relating to our mills at Meal Bank, near Kendal."

The excrements of my workpeople are removed to be used as manure on land. At the head of the river Kent a reservoir is formed for impounding the flood water, and an equalable volume is allowed to flow down the river channel daily, which is a great benefit in drought. If similar reservoirs were formed at the heads of the Mint and Sprint, tributaries of the Kent, the river would be kept comparatively pure."

Thomas Constable,Solicitor,"Solicitor for Mr. Crompton Stansfield, of Esholt Hall.","Have been solicitor for Mr. Crompton Stansfield (whose estate is situated on the river Aire, below the junction of the Bradford Beck), for a great many years. Was examined, along with other witnesses, before the Rivers Pollution Commission (1865) as to the injury to the Esholt Hall estate by the state of the waters of the river Aire and of the Guiseley and Yeadon Beeks, which flow through the estate, and near the Hall, into the said river. The state of the waters has not improved since then. About two years ago the very rent then taken for the Hall, consequent on the state of the waters, was further considerably lowered to induce the occupier to stay. He has within the present month given notice to quit at the expiration of the current year; and he states that he does so with reluctance, as the place suits him otherwise, and that he leaves entirely on account of the excessive offensiveness of the waters, which he has occasion to believe is injurious to health. The residential mansion of Esholt Hall is therefore likely to become derelict and useless if the state of the waters cannot be improved; and the depreciation of the Esholt Hall estate generally from the same cause is very considerable. As regards the river Aire, Mr. Stansfield has been comparatively powerless to prevent the mischief in consequence of its very gradual growth and the multitude of contributors to it. Solicitor to Mr. Compton Stansfield, Esholt Hall - cont. As regards Guiseley and Yeadon Becks, Mr. Stansfield has not been powerless at law; but, practically, he could not have enforced his rights, by injunction or otherwise, to have the waters of the becks flowing down from those villages pure, without stopping the trade and manufactures by which the population live and the country flourishes. On the Guiseley Beck considerable efforts have been made by the principal manufacturers to purify the discharges from their mills, but with very partial effect for the improvement of the water; and as regards the dye water, with no effect at all. The present state of the law leaves the alternative to Mr. Stansfield for ruin to his manufacturing neighbours if he enforces the law, or ruin to his residential estate if he takes no steps to enforce it. Moreover, there are such multitudinous small contributions to the nuisances, as well on the becks as on the river, that it may well be doubted whether any legal steps that might be taken could effectually cure the evil. There comes to this, that in such a case as Mr. Stansfield's, and as property generally on the rivers and streams in the manufacturing districts, the law, that persons higher up a stream may not foul it to the prejudice of those lower down, is virtually and practically abrogated; for a law that cannot be enforced is no law, but a mere delusion. As therefore there is no available law for the protection of rivers and streams in these manufacturing and populous districts, legislation is urgently needed for them. The principle or foundation of such legislation ought to be that all who enjoy the privilege of discharging their sewage into property that is not their own should pay for the privilege, and pay for it more or less in proportion to the extent and degree to which they avail themselves of it. A sewage board should therefore be constituted for each sufficiently extensive manufacturing and populous district in which the common law is at fault, and has become practically worthless. Such board should have power to impose a sewage tax, from such they should be exempted who could show that they disposed of their sewage on their own land exclusively, and which should be mitigated against others in the proportion that they ameliorated the character of their sewage discharges. Without such, serious in the case of greatly polluted discharges, but proportionately mitigated in case of amelioration, there will be no inducement to manufacturers and others to avail themselves of the purifying process that science may point out. Inasmuch as sanitary legislation has hitherto stopped, by ordering drains to be made, but never providing outfalls for such drainage, and consequently after much cost in a given stream an injunction is frequently obtained to prevent the outfall into the proposed stream, the board should have power to order the construction of proper outfalls in every case where required. They should also have power to require the adoption in all cases of the remedies for the purification of the water that can reasonably be required. They should also have power compulsorily to purchase land necessary for outfalls, filtering ponds, and other necessary works, and that in a speedier and less expensive way than the Land Clauses Act provides, and by means of official valuers. Lastly, to the extent that the nuisance to streams and rivers cannot be cured, but must be allowed to exist for the benefit of the general population, power should vest in the board to make compensation to the owners of property injured, as in the case of Esholt Hall, by the effects of a nuisance that must be borne for the convenience of the general public."

Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly olive oil, of the value of £250. The waste produced in carding is used over again, and the remainder sold for manure. Have not milled cloth for two years, so do not use any alkali, or urine. Use steam, 40 nominal horse-power. Consume 500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads.

William Robinson,Printer,"Isle of Cinder, Leeds","My works are situated on the river Aire. Employ 25 hands. Rateable value of works, £96. The bed has been silted up, caused by solid refuse thrown into it. My works are not affected by floods. When I was a boy I have caught fish in the river, but it is polluted by all kinds of impurities, that no fish can now live in it. It is polluted also by mines near Skipton. Obtain supply of water jointly for engine and boiler purposes from the Waterworks Company and from a well. Consume yearly from waterworks alone 1,330,000 gallons. If the river were rendered clear and colourless it would be a direct money value to me of £341 10s. yearly. I am not able to give an estimate of the value of the goods operated upon at my works, as I only print, and do not manufacture the goods. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works is conveyed into the river. Use yearly 15 tons of dye waters, chiefly logwood and fustic. The spent dye stuffs are burnt, and I do not use any bleaching materials. Do not use either soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam, 5 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 330 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted away to railways for ballast. The excrements of my workplace are turned to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers should be compelled to burn the spent dye stuffs instead of turning them into rivers and streams, and that the liquid refuse should be filtered and precipitated. But there is far too much business done on the banks of the river and its tributaries for the water to be ever rendered as clear as it was when I first knew it."
"Watson, Walker, & Quickfall",Manufacturing Chemists,"Skinner Lane and Sheeps Carr Street, Leeds","Our works are situated on Sheeps Carr Beck, a tributary of the river Aire. Employ 23 hands. Rateable value of works, £320. The beck has silted up considerably, partly from manufacturing refuse, and partly from town sewage. Our works are occasionally flooded, caused by the silting up of the bed of the stream. The Sheeps Carr Beck was 40 or 50 years ago pure and clear, and dyers, whose works were situated on its banks, washed their scarlet, crimson, and other bright-colored cloths, by throwing them into the stream; they were then producing colours of superior brilliancy. Small fish abounded in the stream at that time; but since then it has gradually become more and more polluted, and is now so filthy and black as to be almost unfit for any purpose whatever. Some portion, however, of the Beck has lately been very much improved by confining the stream in a narrow channel; and the bed has been paved, which has to some extent cured the evil of silting up. Solid matters thrown into it are more rapidly carried away by a flood. The Town Council have lately obtained parliamentary powers to carry out and further extend improvement in the bed of the beck for a length of two miles. We obtain supply of water from the stream, from wells, and from waterworks; but it is not at all clear. We make very little difference to us, as we obtain the chief part of our supply from wells. We use and produce very common 150 tons, indigo 20 tons, oil of vitriol 30 tons, copperas 30 tons, ammonia 40 tons, and lime 60 tons. Produce refined indigo 10,000 lbs., extract of indigo 150 tons, cudbear 120 tons, cochineal liquid 100 tons, and soap, 100 tons. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works is thrown into the stream. Use steam, 46 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 3,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away. We suggest that the beds of rivers flowing through towns should be paved, in a manner similar to the works now being carried on in the Sheeps Carr Beck. If refuse from manufacturers and sewage of towns must necessarily be thrown into rivers and streams, the plan now being carried out in Sheeps Carr Beck of paving the bed and forming an invert in the channel, is perhaps the best plan of mitigating the worst evils, which generally result from the practice of throwing polluted materials into streams; as by this means all the solid refuse matters are carried away by the stream with much more rapidity than formerly, and before they have time to enter putrefaction or decay."

Opposite works the bed of the river has silted up very considerably; 40 years ago the bed was was 5 or 6 feet deeper than at present, and the silting up to this great depth has been caused by ashes and rubbish thrown in by manufacturers and others. Formerly trout were very plentiful in the stream, but now no living thing can exist except rats, which feed on the dead carcases of animals thrown in. The river for more than half a mile above my works is very seriously polluted by town sewage and refuse from mills, manufactories, and works; and in the summer the stench is so bad the smell is perceptible for more than half a mile off. Obtain a supply of water from the river for manufacturing purposes; but do not know the annual consumption at my works. If the river were rendered clearer and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to me. I manufacture yearly 100 tons of goods, of the value of 25,000.

I suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that every manufacturer should be compelled to filter the waste liquid produced at his works before allowing it to flow into the streams, that solid refuse should be kept out of the streams, and that town sewage should be utilized. Keighley is very excellently situated for conveying the sewage to land; but if the polluted water is turned away on to land, and prevented from flowing past my mill, I shall be deprived of water power, and the public will have to pay me compensation for it. Every person to whom a list of the queries is sent ought to answer them fairly, but I know that they do not intend to do it in this district, because they pollute the river. One firm in particular pollutes the river, and makes the water milky white for more than a mile in length, and this in summer time is most unbearable.

We have depositing tanks for our own convenience, and the water they contain is used for condensing purposes at the mills situated below our works. We use yearly from 800 to 900 tons of woods and other solid dye-wares, 400 to 500 tons of alum, 100 tons of potash, soda, sulphate of copper, ammonia, glauber salts, and soap.

We obtain supply of water jointly from the wells, and from surface drainage; but are unable to give the quantity of water consumed yearly at our works; it is a very large quantity. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would not affect us very materially in money value. We are unable to state the quantity of goods manufactured by us yearly. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, excepting soap-suds, flows direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly, 61,262 lbs. of dyewares, as logwood, camwood, barwood, fustic, argol, Sander's, madder, alum, copperas, and bi-chrome, cubebs, aniseed, and other copperas. The spent dyestuffs are burned. Use yearly, 7,500 gallons of bleach liquor, value of 1,500l. Produce yearly 1,100 tons of wool in the process of carding; the best of it is re-used, and the remainder is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap, 11 tons; alkali, 5 tons; urine, 80 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease; by which we gain seven guineas a year. Use steam, 2,600 nominal horse-power.

George Hinchcliffe,Cotton Spinner and Manufacturer,"Stoodley Bridge, Todmorden","My mills are situated on the Calder. Employ 156 hands. Rateable value of mills, 375l. The bed of the river has silted up, caused mainly by the erection of weirs for the purpose of obtaining power for the mills; these obstructions prevent the free course of water down the channel; and in a heavy rainfall the property on the adjoining banks is flooded. The silting up is due also to solid refuse from mills and houses thrown into the bed of the stream. My works are affected by floods. The river is polluted by works above, and refuse from coal mines.

Barker Sutcliffe,Manufacturing,"Manholm Mill, Todmorden","My works are situated on the Calder. Employ 80 hands. Rateable value of works, 158l. 5s. The bed of the river has silted up, caused by d‚àö©bris washed down from the hills, and large quantities of ashes and other solid refuse continuously thrown into the river bed; also by weirs and dams erected across the river to convey water into goits for manufacturing purposes. My works are affected by floods. The condition of the bed of the river has materially changed during the last 10 years, the date at which my mill was erected; it has risen more than five feet. The river is considerably polluted by works above, mines, and by town sewage. Obtain supply of water from the Rochdale canal; but do not know the annual consumption at my works. If the river were rendered clean and colourless, from which I might derive a supply of water, it would be worth 20l. a year for supplying the boilers alone, besides being of considerable value for other purposes.

The bed of the river has silted up very much more than a foot during the last four years, being at present nearly level with the roadway. This has been caused by the great quantity of ashes, cinders, and dross daily thrown into the river from mills and iron works in the town; also from gravel and stone brought down from the hill sides in time of flood, which latter cannot be washed away owing to weirs forming obstructions in the river bed. In 1868 a very destructive flood occurred, and we sustained a damage of more than 500l., since which time our works have been upon two or three occasions affected by floods. The river is polluted to a slight extent by works above, and it is seriously polluted by works below us, and by mines.

The bed of the river has silted up near our works, and we attribute the cause of it to the Brothers' chemical works, and also to ashes and refuse thrown in by millowners at Sowerby Bridge (in defiance of the Act of Parliament) which are washed down by floods. These (Canal) mills are situated considerably above the level of the river, but at Meanwood Mills the dam for the water-wheel is constantly silting up from the before-mentioned cases. We obtained an injunction against Messrs. Norris some years ago, to restrain them from casting refuse into the river; but it is now hard to amend a letter. The river is very seriously polluted by all kinds of manufacturing refuse, and by sewage, the water being always in a filthy state, especially in the summer, when the effluvia arising from it is almost unbearable. The water in the river then flows almost stagnant in pools, but periodical floods wash it away, and to some extent purify the bed of the stream.

Our works are not affected by floods; formerly there was a large volume of water flowing down the stream, but it has been diverted for the stone quarries. The river is not polluted by works above, nor by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river, from wells, and also from reservoirs formed by ourselves for impounding water, cannot give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, goods of the value of 160,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the stream, and the effluent water from the soapsuds also flows into the stream. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, 2,000 gallons of olive oil, of the value of about 440l. Use yearly about 150 packs of soap. The soapsuds are sold to a grease extractor, for which we receive 50l. a year. Use yearly, 1,500 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted away to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed and used for agricultural purposes. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that liquid and solid refuse from manufacturers and works should be conveyed into settling tanks, and sufficient time allowed for the matters held in suspension to deposit; and by the use of several of these tanks (the liquid flowing from one into the other), seven-eighths of the pollution would, in our opinion, be arrested and prevented from passing into the river or stream. In manufacturers or works where there is little room for the construction of tanks, several millowners or proprietors, whose works are situated on the same stream, might combine together, and settling tanks might be formed below the lowest works to receive the liquid refuse from their several works."

The Bradford Dyeing Company,Dyers,"Rawfolds, Liversedge","Our works are situated on the Rawfolds Beck, an affluent of the Calder. Employ 70 hands. Rateable value of works, £368. The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by ashes and other solid refuse thrown into it. Our works are not affected by floods, but the land adjoining to the works is occasionally flooded, caused by the silting up of the bed of the stream. The stream is seriously polluted by works above, and the water is rendered useless to us from that cause. Obtain supply of water from wells and bore-holes, and consume yearly, 62,000 gallons.

We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future that all solid and liquid refuse should be taken out of rivers and streams, and that in manufacturing districts sewers should be constructed on each side of rivers and streams to intercept the sewage and liquid refuse. This refuse should be conducted to convenient places, passed through filter beds, and purified before being allowed to flow into rivers and streams; and also that a rate should be levied in the district for carrying out and maintaining this work."
J. B. Oldfield, Medical Officer for the Heckmondwike District of Dewsbury Union,"Hill Top House, Heckmondwike","This district is daily growing more important, and contains within it a large population. From the head of the valley at Lowmoor to Ravensthorpe, near Sawbury, there is a population of about 40,000 persons. One of the tributaries of the river Calder flows down this valley, receiving the drainage and pollutions of towns and various manufactories in connexion with them. Our large rivers are often more polluted by towns and villages on a tributary than by those on their banks. The river Spen, which flows very high, was so spoiled a variety of fish, at present has the appearance of ink, and in fact is the receptacle of every abomination. I trust that the Government will take the necessary steps to remove the evils arising from these pollutions, for I have not much faith in local authorities, especially in manufacturing districts; they are so accustomed to shirks. I think the agitation of our Corporation just now will end in nothing. If a bill is passed by the Government to form drainage districts, the Heckmondwike valley ought to be made into a separate one, for it has little to do with other portions of the neighborhood, except in polluting the Calder, and its connexion with Dewsbury and Batley in the waterworks."

The bed of the river has not silted up to any great extent, and the condition of it has not changed within our knowledge during the last 20 years. It is polluted by works above, not very much, but it is considerably polluted by works below to a very great extent, because the owners of mills are not prevented from doing it, although they threaten us with proceedings if we pollute the stream; it is not polluted by us. Obtain supply of water from a reservoir at the head of the stream which is formed for manufacturing purposes, and the whole of the millers on the stream pay rates for supporting and maintaining this supply. Some of the millowners allege that they have a prescriptive right (20 years) to foul the water of the stream. The river at its source, from which we obtain our supply, is clean enough for any other purpose except drinking; but when it flows down the river course for two miles it is so extensively polluted that it is as black as ink, so that the drinking of it clean opposite our works would be of no direct monetary value to us. Manufacturer yearly 1,200 packs of goods, of the value of 18,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dyes or bleaches.

The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We are of opinion that 90 per cent. of the liquid refuse from manufactories and mills could be kept out of rivers and streams which is now sent into them if depositing tanks and filters were adopted. Four years ago we built a dyeworks connected with our works, but have been prevented from using it because a dyer whose works are situated 300 yards below us near the junction of Blakebourne with the Calder, and whose works have only been in operation for seven or eight years, threatens us with proceedings if we turn our liquid refuse into the stream, although he with impunity himself turns all the liquid refuse from his dye vats into the stream, and we are therefore obliged to send to him the whole of our goods to dye. If our dyeworks were in operation we should be able to comply with the standards of purity recommended in the report of the Rivers Pollution Commission on the Mersey and Ribble Basins, and we are of opinion that everybody could bring all their liquid refuse to the standard of purity before turning it into rivers and streams."

The Tanned Leather Company,Tanners,"Armett Works, Greenfield","Our tanyards are situated on an affluent of the Tame, a tributary of the Mersey. Employ 65 hands. Rateable value of tanyards, £141. The bed of the stream has silted up owing to the solid refuse thrown into it and brought down in time of flood. The country has been denuded of wood within the last 70 or 80 years, and mosses a good deal drained; consequently the heavy rains have nothing to retain them, and they flow off in considerable floods, carrying sand and debris, and silt up the bed of the streams. Our tanyards are affected by floods. There has been no change in the condition of the river within our knowledge, during the last seven years. The stream is not polluted by works above, but the Tame is seriously polluted. One of our firm, much to his surprise, caught in the Tame, at Upper Mill, one mile above this place, six small fish in good condition, showing that fish can still exist in the stream although it is badly polluted. The stream is not polluted by mines within our knowledge. Obtain supply of water from springs, but cannot give the annual consumption at our tanyards.

Consume yearly 350 tons of coal, the ashes from which are ground and mixed with lime to be used for building purposes. The excrements of our workplace are removed on to land, and used as manure. We are of opinion that if all manufacturers were compelled to neutralise acid or alkali flowing into rivers, it would improve matters very much. Thoroughly cleansing the filter ponds through which the polluted water could pass would try to the river would deprive it of its deleterious substances, and would probably not be very costly. If great care is not taken, nothing is more deadly than refuse from a paper mill; yet in mines, close under power mill stream, very fine trout can be seen in great numbers, showing that such manufactures can exist and do exist, without polluting the stream. The same means in other districts should produce similar results."

The condition of the stream has not changed with our remembrance. The stream is discoloured by refuse from dye works and by all the woollen cloth mills to some but not to a serious extent. There are no mines in this district. We use the water of the river for all purposes at our works, but are not able to state the quantity. We take what is required from the stream, and return the water after use. Except after heavy rains, or when the mud in the bed of the river is artificially disturbed, the stream is sufficiently clear and colourless for all our manufacturing purposes. We manufacture yearly 2,550 cwt. of goods, of the value of 120,000. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing, 800,000 gallons.

Rateable value of mills, 125l. The bed of the river has not silted up, as it is cleared out periodically; otherwise it would silt up to a considerable extent and become a nuisance. The custom is to send the mud down the stream till it reaches the Severn. This plan ought to be abandoned, and the mud should be wheeled out of the bed of the stream and utilized. Our works are not affected by floods. Twenty years ago the stream here was comparatively pure and the water beautifully clear and admirably suited for business purposes; it is now polluted by the refuse from all the shoddy works above, which at times interferes with our wool washing process, and if continued will lead to a lawsuit or compel us to adopt some other mode, more expensive, of washing. The river is polluted by works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river and from springs, and consume yearly in washing and for cleansing purposes, 6,000,000 gallons. Clean water is a necessity in our business, and we must, if possible, prevent its further pollution. We are anxious to see some general rules for avoiding pollution imperative on all manufacturers. We manufacture yearly 25 tons of goods of the value of 12,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 4,000,000 gallons. We have no depositing tanks, and the whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials.

The excrements of our workplace are collected and utilized as manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all manufacturers be compelled to return the water used in the various processes to the stream practically free from impurities and colouring matter, and that town sewage should be prevented from being turned into rivers. This would, in the case of the manufacturers in the Frome valley, involve but little trouble or difficulty."

Obtain supply of water jointly from river, wells, and water-works; consume about 54,000,000 gallons yearly. If the water is rendered clear and colorless, the direct money value to us would be inappreciable. We have three condensing towers, 80 feet high 5 feet square; two, 32 feet by 8 feet square. There are also two flush towers. Our works are 38 feet 6 inches high, and 5 feet 4 inches wide. The contents of the seven towers are 12,175 cubic feet. We use, and produce yearly, common salt 7,000 tons, sulphur 200 tons, pyrites 6,250 tons, limestone 7,200 tons, lime 2,000 tons, oxide of manganese 1,150 tons, bleaching powder 1,500 tons, alkali 4,200 tons, ammoniacal liquor 1,468,000 gallons, phosphate of lime and bones 73 tons, nitrate of soda 240 tons. We condense for use yearly 2,000,000 gallons of acid, 26‚àû-27‚àû Twad., and 740,000 gallons 22‚àû-24‚àû Twad. We condense and run to waste yearly 2,205,000 gallons of acid 20‚àû Twad. We produce yearly 5,950,000 gallons of liquid refuse, which flow into depositing tanks, and thence into the river. The whole of the alkali waste at our works is operated upon, and 400 tons of sulphur are recovered annually, at a cost of about 51s. 2d. per ton. The sulphur recovered is about equal to the best seconds Silesian value from 5l. to 7l. a ton. We do not recover the manganese from the waste chloride of manganese, but we are erecting Deacon's chlorine apparatus, which will avoid the production of waste manganese. Use steam, 105 (Boulton & Watt standard) nominal horse-power. Use yearly 21,500 tons of coal. Make 3,200 tons of ashes, which are thrown on to our waste heap. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed from dry earth closets, and used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer."

My works are affected by floods, but not so much as formerly. The stream was formerly clear, and there was a plentiful supply of trout; it is now in a very foul condition, especially so in summer, owing to pollutions from various sources above. It is not polluted within my knowledge by mines. Obtain supply of water partly from the stream, but chiefly from wells. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of very considerable value to me, because the water is softer than the water obtained from wells.

William Jones,Tanner,"Frome Bridge, Bristol","My tanyard is situated on the Frome, an affluent of the Lower Avon, a tributary of the Severn. Employ 10 hands. Rateable value of tanyard, £66. The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by liquid and solid refuse thrown into it, and by long neglect. My tanyard is affected by floods, more especially in the last few years; partly owing to the silting up of the bed of the river, but partly owing to the arching over of a portion of the river near the centre of the city, and so confining the watercourse. I have been a resident in this locality all my life (48 years) and connected as assistant manager of these works for years. I recollect the stream being pure enough for all manufacturing purposes, but for many years it has been so polluted by sewage and drainage as to be unfit for manufacturing purposes, and is most pestilential during the summer months; it is not polluted to my knowledge by mines. Do not obtain a supply of water from the river, because it is so polluted, nor from two wells sunk expressly on our premises, which have been contaminated by the water of the river infiltrating into them; but obtain supply of water from waterworks, and could consume yearly 320,000 gallons. If the river, from which I might derive a supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to me of 20l. a year. Tan yearly, hides 50 tons, and produce yearly, leather 20 tons. Use yearly, lime 1 ton, bark 100 tons, shuma 1 ton, and pigeons‚ dung 5 bushels.

Do not use any dye wares. Produce yearly 150,000 gallons of liquid refuse, chiefly spent tan liquor and lime water, which flow direct into the river, as the authorities will not allow us to turn them into the sewers. The spent lime deposited at the bottom of the pits is carried away afterwards for manure. Do not use steam as power. Consume yearly 24 tons of coal, the ashes of which are carted away for manure. The excrements of my workpeople are conveyed by public sewers into the river. I suggest that the best means of avoiding pollution of rivers in future would be the completion of the system of side or intercepting sewers, which system was commenced by the Bristol Board of Health in or about 1853, but has only been partially carried out, and from which plan, though of great cost to us in the shape of rates, we have received no benefit. The rapid growth of the suburbs of the city and villages, nearly 1,000 houses being built before any proper system of drainage is provided, such an immense quantity of sewage and drainage has poured into the river as to pollute it to a great extent. This is an increasing evil, which ought to be checked. A great deal can be done by cleaning out and improving the bed of the river for some years."
