Use yearly soap 60,000 lbs., alkali 12,000 lbs., but no mine. The soaps are treated for the recovery of grease, and we gain by the extraction 701 per annum. Use steam 35 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,100 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople flow into the mill goit, and thence into the stream. Have no suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams."
PART II 53.jpeg,Edward Smith & Company,Worsted Manufacturers,"Industry Mills, Thornton Road, Bradford.","Our works are situated near Bradford Beck. Employ 200 hands. As we rent power as well as premises from Mr. William Carter, of Neal Street, Bradford, we do not know the rateable value of works, or the annual consumption of water for condensing purposes. The water we require for other purposes is only a small quantity, and this we obtain from the Bradford Corporation. We manufacture, yearly, goods of the value of 50,000l, but do not produce any liquid refuse, Do not use oil or soap. As the steam power is rented with the premises we are unable to give the horse-power; the quantity of coal used; or to state what is done with the ashes. The excerments of our work-people are conveyed by a sewer into the Beck. Have no suggestions to offer."

Employ 150 hands. Rateable value of works, 248l. The goit is polluted by refuse from manufactories, and by sewage; obtain our supply of water from the goit, but do not know the annual consumption at our works. We manufacture yearly 254,800 lbs. of goods, of the value of 36,400l. Do not use oil or soap. Use steam, 15 nominal horse-power; but as this power is rented with the premises we are unable to give the weight of coal used; or what is done with the ashes. The excerments of our workpeople are removed by carts and used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer."
PART II 54.jpeg,James Procter,Worsted Manufacturer,"Penny Mills, North Road, Bradford.","Our works are situated on a stream which flows into Bradford Beck, a tributary of the Aire. Employ 90 hands. Do not know the rateable value of the works as the landlord pays rates. The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The stream is polluted by works above, and by sewage. Obtain supply of water partly from the river and partly from the corporation waterworks; but do not know the annual consumption at our works. We manufacture yearly from 60 to 70 tons of cotton, of the value of from 22,000l to 24,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows into the brook. We do not use dye wares, bleaching materials, oil, soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam, 10 nominal horse-power; but as we hire steam-power from Mr. B. Ingle, the proprietor of the mills, we are unable to give the weight of coal used, or to state what is done with the ashes. The urine of our workpeople is carted away to woollen mills to scour cloth, and the solid excrement is conveyed to land to be used as manure. Have no suggestions to offer."
PART II 54.jpeg,Dantel Sharp & Sons,Worsted Manufacturers,"Tatler Street, Thornton Road, Bradford.","Our works are situated upon a goit which flows into Bradford Beck, a tributary of the Aire. Employ 75 hands. Rateable value of works, 390l. The bed of the stream has silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The water of the goit is as black as ink. This has been its state for the last 15 years. It is very seriously polluted by works above, by town sewage; but not by mines. Obtain supply of water partly from the goit and partly from waterworks, but are unable to state the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly 124,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 18,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows unfettered into the goit, and thence into the Beck. We do not use dye wares, bleaching materials, oil, alkali, soap, or urine. Use steam, two-thirds of 23 nominal horse-power, there being other tenants besides ourselves; we are therefore unable to state the quantity of coal used, or what is done with the ashes. The excerments of our workpeople flow into the goit and thence into the Beck. We have no suggestions to offer."

Have no special suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams."
PART II 55.jpeg,Taylor & Bateman,Worsted Manufacturers,"Valley Works, Manningham, near Bradford.","Our works are situated on Bradford Beck, a tributary of the Aire. Employ 280 hands. The bed of the stream has silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. There has been very little alteration in the condition of the stream during the last 5 years. It is polluted to an enormous extent by every species of liquid and solid refuse, but not by mines. We hire room and power, and our landlord pays rates and supplies the water for our consumption, and we are unable to give the quantity used yearly. If the clear, from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to us. We manufacture yearly goods 360,000 lbs, of the value of 50,0000l. Produce yearly, liquid refuse, as soapsuds, 2,470,000 gallons. This and the whole of the other waste liquid flows direct into Bradford Beck. Ware or bleaching materials, but use yearly 380 gallons do not use either dye ware or 814, also soap 35 packs, and soda as 85 cwt. The soap-suds are not treated for the recovery of grease. As we only hire power from Messrs. S. Stultiffe and Sons, who are joint occupiers with us, we are unable to state the nominal steam power, the quantity of coal used, what is done with the ashes, or what is done with the excrements of our workpeople."
