                "reply": "Our works are situated on Thornton Beck, an affluent of the Bradford Beck, a tributary of the Aire. Employ 70 hands. We are not able to give the rateable value of the works, as they have not been used for the purpose to which they are now devoted. The bed of the stream has silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The stream is tolerably clear near to our works, although it is very foul a little below and nearer to the town. It is polluted by liquid refuse from manufactories, but not by mines. Obtain supply of water from the Bradford Corporation Waterworks, and consume yearly 9,300,000 gallons. We bleach about 150,000l, of goods of the value of 10,000l, and dye yearly 2,000,000 lbs. of goods of the value of 150,000l. We produce 9,300,000 gallons of liquid refuse more or less polluted; this flows into the sewers and thence into the stream. We use yearly from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 lbs. of dye wares of all kinds. Part of the dye stuffs are burned. Use 30,000 to 30,000 lbs. of bleaching materials, principally chloride of lime and oil of vitriol. Use yearly, soap 12,000 lbs., but neither alkali or urine. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 20 nominal horsepower. Consume yearly, 2,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used partly to repair roads, and to make mortar for building purposes. The excerements of our workpeople are used as manure on land adjoining our works. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has not changed within our knowledge. It is polluted very seriously by works above not by mines. Obtain supply of water for condensing purposes from the stream; for washing and other processes of manufacture from wells; and consume yearly for washing 155,000 gallons. If the river were clear and colourless, from which we might derive our supply of water it would be of considerable money value to us, but cannot fix the amount. We manufacture yearly, from 170 to 180 tons of goods, of the value of from 50,000 to 60,000. Produce yearly, 60,000 gallons of liquid refuse, as soapsuds; this flows into depositing tanks; the other waste liquid produced flows directly into the stream. We do not use either dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, 8½ tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 500l. Produce yearly, 6 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is partly sold to waste dealers, and partly used for manure. Use yearly, soap 13 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 90l. a year. Use steam, 45 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,300 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads and footpaths. The excerements of our workpeople are used for manure. No suggestions to offer.",

The other liquid refuse flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly 1,000 gallons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 250l. Produce 5,000 lbs. of waste wool in carding; sold to farmers as manure. Use yearly, soap 27,390 lbs., and alkali 91,690 lbs. The aspsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 30l. a year. Use steam, 60 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal; make 400 tons of ashes, which are used to repair streets. The excrements of my workpeople are removed by a contractor under the Bradford Corporation.

The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The channel of the stream is some-times dry, and at other times a fair volume of water flows down. It has been much in the same condition for the last 50 years. The river is so fearfully polluted that the water is unfit for use, except after a very heavy flood; it is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells, bore holes, and sometimes from the stream, when clear. Consume yearly from bore holes 15,000,000 gallons, and from Beck 750,000 gallons. As we have a good supply of water from our wells we should not use the Beck water to any extent, even if it were rendered clear and colourless. We manufacture yearly 1,040,000 lbs. of goods of the value of 174,000 gallons. Produce yearly liquid refuse from soapsuds 3,000,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks; the other waste liquids produced at our works flow directly into the Beck. We do not use either dye ware's or bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,000. Produce yearly 52,000 lbs. of waste wool in carding, which is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly 100 tons of soap, but no alkali or urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain from 80l to 90l a year. Use steam, 135 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 4,500 tons of coal, and make about 800 tons of ashes, which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Spin yearly 96,000 lbs. of fibre, and weave 156,000 lbs. of yarn. The waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye ware's, bleaching materials, soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam. Consume yearly 780 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure.

The bed of the stream occasionally silts up, but not any appreciable extent. Our works are affected by floods by reason of contraction of the channel of the stream, where covered over above our works. The condition of the stream becomes gradually worse year by year. It is seriously polluted by town sewage and refuse from dye and other works; it is as noisome as possible, and the temperature of the water is raised, by being so constantly used for manufacture processes to from 80° to 90° Fahrenheit; it is not polluted by mines Obtain supply of water jointly from wells and from water-works, an consume yearly about 9,000,000 gallons. If the stream from which we might derive our supply of water were rendered clear and colour less, it would be a direct money value to us of 230l. a year. We manufacture yearly about 2,500,000 lbs. of wool of the value 200,0001. Produce yearly liquid refuse, as soapsuds, 1,200,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks, but the other waste liquor refuse flows direct into the stream. Do not use either dye wares bleaching materials. Use yearly 12 tons of olive oil, of the value 6001. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is used for manure. Use yearly, soap 111 cwt., alkali 400 cwt., but no lime. Soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 250 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 4,200 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used in making mortar for building purposes; and the remainder tipped into old quarries, or used as ballast by the railway company Two-thirds of the excrements of our workpeople are used for manure and the remainder is cast into the Beck.

The bed of the stream is entirely dry for months during the summer above the point where we discharge our liquid refuse into it. Our works are not affected by floods. Obtain supply of water from wells sunk to the old coal workings, from boreholes below the coal workings, and a small quantity from springs; and consume yearly, 450,000,000 gallons. We dye, yearly, goods of the value of about 1,500,000. The whole of the water consumed, viz., 450,000,000 gallons, after being used for dyeing and washing purposes, is discharged into the Beck. We have depositing tanks for our own convenience, and the water they contain is used for condensing purposes at the mills situated below our works. We use yearly from 800 to 900 tons of woods and other solid dye-wares, 400 to 500 tons of alum, bichromate of potash, soda, sulphate of copperas, ammonia, glauber salts, and soap. We also use 400 tons of sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids. The soapsuds cannot be separated in our operations, and therefore cannot be treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, about 1,000 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 21,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used principally as ballast for railways. The excrement of our workpeople are collected, and used as manure on land. We do not see how pollution can be avoided in our case, except by stopping our works. Have no suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams, as it is a difficult question to be dealt with.",

The stream is polluted by liquid refuse from manufactories; not to my knowledge by lead in mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from bore-holes, and from waterworks of the Bradford Corporation, and consume yearly 22,030,000 gallons. If the stream, from which I might derive my supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, I should not be able to use it profitably, as the supply is so uncertain. I bleach and dye yearly 2,500,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of from 190,000l, to 200,000l. About one-third of the water used is foulled; but the remainder is only slightly polluted. I have no depositing tanks; the whole of the waste liquid flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 900,000 lbs. of dye woods, drugs, and amiline colours. All the spent dye stuffs are mixed with the coal and burned. Use yearly as bleaching materials, sulphur 11,200 lbs., chloride of lime 9,000 lbs.; do not use any oil. Use, yearly, soap 500 packs. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease by a neigh-bour, and I receive an equivalent in water. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 3,880 tons of coal, the ashes from which are taken away every day by farmers. The excrements of our workpeople flow by waterclosets into the stream.

There has been very little alteration in the condition of the stream during the last 5 years. It is polluted to an enormous extent by every species of liquid and solid refuse, but not by mines. We hire room and power, and our landlord pays rates and supplies the water for our consumption, and we are unable to give the quantity used yearly. If the clear, from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to us. We manufacture yearly goods 360,000 lbs, of the value of 50,0000l. Produce yearly, liquid refuse, as soapsuds, 2,470,000 gallons. This and the whole of the other waste liquid flows direct into Bradford Beck. Ware or bleaching materials, but use yearly 380 gallons do not use either dye ware or 814, also soap 35 packs, and soda as 85 cwt. The soap-suds are not treated for the recovery of grease. As we only hire power from Messrs. S. Stultiffe and Sons, who are joint occupiers with us, we are unable to state the nominal steam power, the quantity of coal used, what is done with the ashes, or what is done with the excrements of our workpeople.",
