The bed of the river has silted up very much in the districts above Bishop Auckland and Walsingham owing to refuse poured in from works and lead mines. Thirty years ago the river opposite our works was pure; now it is very filthy, especially in droughty weather. It is polluted by lead mines, town sewage, refuse from collieries, paper mills, and other works to a serious extent. Obtain supply of water jointly from river, and from waterworks; and consume yearly about 4,000,000 gallons. If the river from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us; without stating precisely we should say at least from 300l. to 400l. yearly. We manufacture yearly 500 tons of goods, of the value of 10,000l. Produce yearly 2,745,000 gallons from dyeing, and 255,000 gallons as soapuds. This refuse flows into depositing tanks, rendered clear by us to the value of 200l., and from thence into the river. We use yearly 210,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly vegetable and a little mineral, also cochineal. The spent dye stuffs are carted away to a rubbish heap. Use yearly as bleaching materials 30 cwt. of sulphur in a solid state. This is evaporated. Use yearly 4,500 gallons of olive and whale oil, of the value of 950l. to 1,000l. Produce yearly 16 tons of waste wool in carding, which is sold to farmers for manure. Use yearly, soap 22 tons; alkali 25 tons; also urine from our workpeople, and a further unknown quantity from the town. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam and water as power: steam 70, water 40, nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 3,500 tons of coal. Make 675 tons of ashes, which are carted away for the repair of neighboring roads and to ash heaps. The excrements of our workplace are discharged into the river through sewers. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all manufacturers and owners of mines (perhaps except lead mines which require further consideration) be compelled to filter all impure water issuing from their premises, and that the sewage be not allowed to enter the stream. For the proper conservancy of rivers and streams, we suggest that a public prosecutor be appointed.",

Produce yearly 10 tons of dust or waste, which is carted away to land for manure. Use steam, 70 nominal horse-power, of which 50 horse-power is condensing. Consume yearly 2,500 tons of coal, and make about 180 tons of ashes, which are turned into the river. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into the river. Have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, as our works are only one and a half miles from the city, and within full flow of the tide. Therefore we are not affected by the pollution flowing down the river.",

We manufacture yearly about 1,300 tons of printing paper, 2,600 tons of half stuff and paper stock. We do not produce any waste, as the esparto roots are burned. Use steam, about 400 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 10,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are deposited on ground near.

If the Skerne water were as pure as the water supplied by the Corporation, it would serve the same purpose for the latter, 50l. a year; but no amount of cleansing would effect this, as the water naturally contains much earthy matter. We produce about 400,000 lbs. of worsted yarn and about 110,000 lbs. of woven fabrics yearly, of the value of 85,000l. Produce liquid refuse in washing, about 1,000,000 gallons yearly. We have no bleaching tanks, and this refuse flows direct into the river. We do not use any dye or bleaching materials. Use 3,000 gallons of Gallipoli oil yearly, value of 800l.

Obtain 4 tons of hair in the process of depilation, which is sold to bricklayers and manufacturers of rugs; also 6 cwt. of fatten matter in the process of sheathing, which is sold to tallow chandlers. There are 63 tanks in my yard; the sizes varying from 5 feet 6 by 3 feet 6 by 4 feet 6 to 8 feet 6 by 8 feet 7 by 5 feet 3. Do not use any dyeing materials. The whole of the liquid refuse produced flows unfiltered into the river. Use steam, 5 nominal horse-power.

Obtain a supply of water from the river, and, except during floods, the entire volume of the stream passes over our water-wheel. The river water is clear, except during floods, when it is discolored by peat from the moors. We manufacture 430,000 lbs.; bleach, 160,000 lbs., and dye, 100,000 lbs. yearly. We are not able to give the volume of liquid refuse produced, which flows unfiltered into the sewers, and thence into the river. Use 42,000 lbs. of dye wares yearly, principally shumace, peachwood, and fustic. The spent dye stuffs are mixed with the excrements of our workpeople and used for manure. Use bleaching materials, yearly, chloride of lime, 49,000 lbs.; salt, 45,000 lbs.; and soap, 6,300 lbs. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 130 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. We remove the excrements of our workpeople twice a week, to be used as manure.

The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows into the river. We have one depositing tank. Formerly, when we combed the wool, we used to filter the soap suds from the wool washing before allowing it to flow into the river. We do not use any dye wares, bleaching materials, soap, alkali, or urine. Use both steam and water as power; 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The whole of the excrements of our workpeople are collected in a tank, mixed with dry earth, and used for manure.

The condition of the stream remains as it was upwards of twenty years ago. There is no appreciable pollution in the river. The water is always clear, except in time of flood. The Addingham mills (Lister & Company), are six miles above us; the river is not polluted by mines. We obtain our supply of water jointly from the river and from the waterworks, but are unable to give an accurate consumption at our works. For many weeks in the year the entire volume of the stream passes over our water-wheel, which we estimate to take 125,000,000 gallons weekly. We manufacture yearly goods of the value of 300,000l., and give goods of the value of 20,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the river. We use as dry wares 90,000 lbs. of wood, fustic, and bi-chromate of potash. The spent dye stuffs are consumed in our boilers. We do not use any bleaching materials. Use of Best Gallipol oil about 20 tons yearly, of the value of 1,000l., also 153,000 lbs. of best Gallipol soft soap. The grease is extracted from the soap dust at an annual gain to us of 1,000l. We do not use either alkali or urine. Use steam as power; water 200, and steam 20, nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,500 tons of coal; the ashes from which are partly thrown into the river, and partly used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

Our works are not affected by floods. The floods and also the small volume of water flowing down the stream are caused by the increased agricultural drainage of the upper portion of the watershed. The river is not polluted by works above, nor by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river, which is quite sufficiently pure for our purposes, but do not know the chemical composition of our works. Manufacture yearly 400,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 50,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 3,000,000 gallons, and from soapuds 2,000,000 gallons. The whole of the waste liquid produced, except soapuds, flows direct into the river. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of Price's and olive oil of the value of 1,200l. Do not produce any liquid refuse in our manufactory. Use yearly soap 8 tons, alkali 1 ton, and urine 400 gallons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease, but as the process has only been in operation for a short time, we are unable to state the amount gained by it. Use both steam and water as power steam, 30 horse, and water 80 nominal horse power. Consume, yearly, coal 1,100 tons, and make about 90 tons of ashes, which are used for filling up hollow places, and repairing the roads. The excrements of our workpeople are regularly removed away from the premises by farmers, and used for manure. We would suggest as best means of avoiding pollution in future, to provide for a constant flow of water down the river channel; that a reservoir or reservoirs should be formed at the head of each main stream to impound the flood water. The cost of the land and works and the expense of maintenance should be defrayed by a rate on all landed property within the watershed, and also on all mill and other property on the banks of the streams. Riparian owners have benefited by their land being drained, and this is carried out to a very great extent in this neighbourhood, so much that the present volume of the water in the streams has greatly decreased, and in summer time there is scarcely any water in the stream. The millowners and manufacturers would also be greatly benefited by the construction of such reservoirs, as they would have an ample and constant supply of water furnished to their works.",

The bed of the stream has silted up slightly, caused by weirs erected across the stream to supply water to the dye houses. Our works are affected to a small extent by floods.The river is generally clear opposite our works ; and probably more so since the river wall was built, which increases the velocity of the current. The river is slightly polluted by a paper mill and a woollen mill above, but before the water reaches our works it is comparatively clear, except in flood time; it is then turbid. The river is not polluted by mines. Obtain our supply of water principally from river, and a small quantity from the waterworks; and consume yearly in dyeing and for steam-engine purposes 1,588,000 gallons. We are unable to state the volume we use for washing. The water of the river is sufficiently clear for our business purposes. As the goods are woven at other works, not near the river, we only give the weight and approximate value of the yarn dyed and finished, which is as follows: linen 650 lbs., value 27l.; woollen 2,460 lbs., value 13,835l., worsted yarn 78,120 lbs., value 7,165l. We produce yearly liquid refuse from dyeing 560,000 gallons, and from spools 2,500 gallons. We have sometimes used depositing buckets, but not now. We do not filter the waste liquid, but it flows direct into the river. Use yearly as dye wares logwood, cochineal, and fustic. The dye stuffs are used for filling up hollow places on our land. We do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 16 tons of Price's and other oils of the value of 600l. We produce yearly about 30 tons of waste wool In the process of carding, which are sold to manure manufacturers. Use yearly, soap 8,178 lbs., and alkali 34,164 lbs. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use both steam and water as power, steam 25, and water 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 470 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair roads for filling up hollow places. The excrements of our workplace are partially used for manure, and are partially thrown into the river. With the exception of the excrement of our workpeople we do not think that the refuse from our works pollutes the river. As manufacturing works do in the aggregate pollute rivers, we suppose that the best means of avoiding pollution in future would be that all solid matters should be kept out and the liquid refuse should be filtered before being passed in. Where there is a local board of health, we think that the entire conservancy of rivers and streams should be in their hands for all purposes; where no local board of health exists, the guardians of the unions (who have already charge and management of streets and dwelling houses) should in our opinion constitute the conservancy board.",

The bed of the stream has silted up certain places, caused by dâÃ Ã¶Â©bris brought down by floods. Our works are not affected by floods, as we rarely remove the silt and obstructions formed at the head of our mill race. There has been little change, if any, in the condition of the river within our knowledge. The river is polluted by works above, but not to a very considerable extent; it is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water chiefly from the river, and partially from the waterworks, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. The river is sufficiently clear for our purposes, and we do not think it could be improved. Manufacture yearly 450,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 55,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 12,000,000 gallons, dyeing 600,000 gallons, and from soapsuds 80,000 gallons. We have depositing tanks for the soapsuds. The other waste liquid flows direct into the river, but sewers are now in course of construction, and the liquid refuse from our works will be then intercepted and carried of the sewage to the town on to land below the town to be there utilized. Use yearly as dye wares, cochineal, logwood, chromate of potash, indigo, and aniline colours. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 30 tons of Price's, coal and Gallipoli oil. Produce yearly 41 tons of waste in the process of carding, which are sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 65, soapsuds 1, ammonia 1ÅÂ© tons, and urine 400 gallons. Use both steam and water as power steam 30 and water 30 nominal horse power. Consume yearly about 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away by the authorities of the town, to be used in repairing roads. The excrements of our work people are applied for manure, and partly turned into the river. We are of opinion that when the sewers, now in course of construction, are completed, the river will be practically clear. We are of opinion that all persons should be prevented from polluting streams, but at the same time we believe that any attempt to maintain a high state of purity in a manufacturing county will entirely fail, and destroy an immense source of wealth, the result of manufacturing industry.",

The bed of the stream has been much improved of late, the course having been made feet wider, and the bed lowered at least six inches. The river is polluted by works above, and especially by the sewage of the town; but works are now in progress for intercepting the sewage on to land below the town. The bed of the river is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water principally from the river, and only occasionally from the waterworks; consume yearly at our works, 10,000,000 gallons. When there is an ample volume of water in the river, the water is sufficiently pure for all our purposes. We give yearly 300,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 30,000l. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing 9,500,000 gallons, from dyeing 400,000 gallons, from soapsuds 100,000 gallons. The whole of the liquid refuse, except soapsuds, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly as dyes, ware dyes woods 179,200 lbs., indigo and cochineal 2,400 lbs., mordants, and copperas 6,720 lbs. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials or oil. Use yearly, soap 5,236 lbs., alkali. 40,320 lbs. and urine 15,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, but as the works for carrying out this process have been so recently erected, we are not able to state the amount we gain by the extraction of the grease. Power: Consume yearly 530 tons of coal; use 30 tons of ash; we pay for their being carted away from our premises. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away for manure. The main sewer for the town now in course of construction passes our works, and will convey the whole of the waste liquids therefrom. The irregular volume of water flowing down the stream in summer is the greatest evil we have to contend with. A constant daily supply of water would be the best means of preserving the purity of the stream. For the remainder of the suggestions upon this point we refer to our evidence (page 86) relating to our mills at Meal Bank, near Kendal.",

The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works flows now into the river, but as before stated, it will be conveyed into the intercepting sewer when it is completed. Use yearly as dyewares logwood 3 tons, redwood 2 tons, cochineal 5,160 lbs., lac-dye 4,300 lbs., cudbear 672 lbs., indigo 850 lbs., wool, 4,480 lbs.; besides small quantities of spirits of salts, oil of vitriol, prussiate of potash, bi-chromate of potash, cream of tartar, and nitrate of tin. The whole of the spent dye-stuffs are run down the river. Do not use any bleaching materials, or oil. Consume yearly 60 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair the roads. The excrements of my workpeople are removed to be used as manure on land. At the head of the river Kent a reservoir is formed for impounding the flood water, and an equalable volume is allowed to flow down the river channel daily, which is a great benefit in drought. If similar reservoirs were formed at the heads of the Mint and Sprint, tributaries of the Kent, the river would be kept comparatively pure.",

The bed of the stream has silted up below our works caused by the throwing in of rubbish. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream is now better than formerly as we have erected retaining walls on each side, to prevent the washing away by floods of the banks of the stream. The river is polluted by works above, not appreciably, but is not polluted by mines. Obtain a supply of water from the stream; and consume yearly about 500,000 lbs. of goods. We manufacture yearly 695,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 72,001l.; 1,800l., 18,000 lbs.; dye 210,600 lbs. of the value of 28,500l. Cannot estimate the volume of liquid refuse produced at our works; but the whole of it flows through a filter formed of engine ashes into the stream. Use yearly as dyewares dyewoods 59,000 lbs.; gambir, shumac, myrobalans 48,000 lbs.; bi-chromate and prussiate of potash, 2,800 lbs.; sulphates of copper and iron, 17,000 lbs.; muriatic, nitric and sulphuric acid, 15,000 lbs.; soda ash, 1,500 lbs.; alum, 800 lbs.; sugar of lead, 2,300 lbs.; methylated spirit 100 gallons.

About one third of the excrements of our workpeople is used for manure; the remainder flows into the stream. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that the whole of the manufactures and works should be filtered, and that the whole of the sewage of towns should be utilized by irrigating land; and we further suggest that local conservancy boards should be formed in those areas, controlled by a general board over the entire basin.",

My works are not affected by floods. The river is polluted by paper mills, and refuse from wool manufacturers higher up the stream; not by mines. Obtain a supply of water from springs; but as I only use it for condensing and then turn it into the Beck, I am not able to give the annual consumption at my works. I do not at present comb the wool I use, but send it out for that purpose. I am taking preparations to do so, and clean water for washing will then be a necessity. I intend to extract the grease from the scours, discharging the effluent water into a pit two yards deep, and filter it before it passes into the Beck. The works are situated high up the stream on a gravel sub-soil, and the water will have to filter through 30 yards of gravel before it can reach the Beck. I do not use any dyes, bleaching materials, soap, or alkali. Use steam, 12 nominal horse-power; consume yearly 470 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of my workplace are mixed with earth and used for manure. I have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

Our works are affected by floods, but not to any serious extent. There has been very little change in the condition of the river during the last 20 years. Fish live in the river above and below our works. The river is polluted by works above, but not by mines. Obtain water for condensing purposes from the river; it is afterwards returned to the river; obtain water for use in dyeing, from springs, and Shipley Waterworks, but have no means of calculating the total volume consumed yearly at my works. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of little value to us to have it always clear. The quantity of water we are unable to get it clear is during a \"fresh,\" when we require nearly 5,000 gallons of goods of the value of 700,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use yearly 320,000 lbs. of logwood and similar dyes; the refuse is thrown into the adjoining stone quarries. Use yearly 15,000 lbs. of bleaching materials, chloride of lime, carbonate of lime, and vitriol. Use yearly Gallipoli oil from 40 to 60 tons, of the value of 2,300l. The material we use is chiefly good and not carted; waste is produced, is sold, and removed from the premises immediately. Use yearly, soap 700,000 lbs., and alkali 40,000 lbs. The soaps are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 900l. a year. Use steam, 2,000 indicated horse-power. Consume nearly 14,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are partly sold to the railway company for ballast, and partly mixed with the excrements of our workpeople, these latter are removed nightly, and sold to farmers for manure. We have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

            "address": "Solicitor for Mr. Crompton Stansfield, of Esholt Hall.",
            "reply": "Have been solicitor for Mr. Crompton Stansfield (whose estate is situated on the river Aire, below the junction of the Bradford Beck), for a great many years. Was examined, along with other witnesses, before the Rivers Pollution Commission (1865) as to the injury to the Esholt Hall estate by the state of the waters of the river Aire and of the Guiseley and Yeadon Beeks, which flow through the estate, and near the Hall, into the said river. The state of the waters has not improved since then. About two years ago the very rent then taken for the Hall, consequent on the state of the waters, was further considerably lowered to induce the occupier to stay. He has within the present month given notice to quit at the expiration of the current year; and he states that he does so with reluctance, as the place suits him otherwise, and that he leaves entirely on account of the excessive offensiveness of the waters, which he has occasion to believe is injurious to health. The residential mansion of Esholt Hall is therefore likely to become derelict and useless if the state of the waters cannot be improved; and the depreciation of the Esholt Hall estate generally from the same cause is very considerable. As regards the river Aire, Mr. Stansfield has been comparatively powerless to prevent the mischief in consequence of its very gradual growth and the multitude of contributors to it. Solicitor to Mr. Compton Stansfield, Esholt Hall - cont. As regards Guiseley and Yeadon Becks, Mr. Stansfield has not been powerless at law; but, practically, he could not have enforced his rights, by injunction or otherwise, to have the waters of the becks flowing down from those villages pure, without stopping the trade and manufactures by which the population live and the country flourishes. On the Guiseley Beck considerable efforts have been made by the principal manufacturers to purify the discharges from their mills, but with very partial effect for the improvement of the water; and as regards the dye water, with no effect at all. The present state of the law leaves the alternative to Mr. Stansfield for ruin to his manufacturing neighbours if he enforces the law, or ruin to his residential estate if he takes no steps to enforce it. Moreover, there are such multitudinous small contributions to the nuisances, as well on the becks as on the river, that it may well be doubted whether any legal steps that might be taken could effectually cure the evil. There comes to this, that in such a case as Mr. Stansfield's, and as property generally on the rivers and streams in the manufacturing districts, the law, that persons higher up a stream may not foul it to the prejudice of those lower down, is virtually and practically abrogated; for a law that cannot be enforced is no law, but a mere delusion. As therefore there is no available law for the protection of rivers and streams in these manufacturing and populous districts, legislation is urgently needed for them. The principle or foundation of such legislation ought to be that all who enjoy the privilege of discharging their sewage into property that is not their own should pay for the privilege, and pay for it more or less in proportion to the extent and degree to which they avail themselves of it. A sewage board should therefore be constituted for each sufficiently extensive manufacturing and populous district in which the common law is at fault, and has become practically worthless. Such board should have power to impose a sewage tax, from such they should be exempted who could show that they disposed of their sewage on their own land exclusively, and which should be mitigated against others in the proportion that they ameliorated the character of their sewage discharges. Without such, serious in the case of greatly polluted discharges, but proportionately mitigated in case of amelioration, there will be no inducement to manufacturers and others to avail themselves of the purifying process that science may point out. Inasmuch as sanitary legislation has hitherto stopped, by ordering drains to be made, but never providing outfalls for such drainage, and consequently after much cost in a given stream an injunction is frequently obtained to prevent the outfall into the proposed stream, the board should have power to order the construction of proper outfalls in every case where required. They should also have power to require the adoption in all cases of the remedies for the purification of the water that can reasonably be required. They should also have power compulsorily to purchase land necessary for outfalls, filtering ponds, and other necessary works, and that in a speedier and less expensive way than the Land Clauses Act provides, and by means of official valuers. Lastly, to the extent that the nuisance to streams and rivers cannot be cured, but must be allowed to exist for the benefit of the general population, power should vest in the board to make compensation to the owners of property injured, as in the case of Esholt Hall, by the effects of a nuisance that must be borne for the convenience of the general public.",

We scribble, spin, and fill 600 packs and dye 400 packs of wool, and manufacture 4,648 ends of cloth. We have eight depositing tanks and three filters. The waste liquid produced at our works is filtered over and over again, and used for condensing purposes. Use yearly 19,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly brown, barwood, camwood, fustic, and bi-chromate of potash. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly Gallipoli oil, but do not know the quantity or value. The waste wood produced in carding is returned to the owners of the goods sent to us to manufacture. Use yearly, 90 tons, alkali 10 tons, and an unknown quantity of lime. We do not extract the grease from the soapsuds. Use steam, as nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are mixed with 'willey' and flue dust, and are carted away for manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers and others should be compelled to filter their liquid refuse before allowing it to flow into rivers and streams.

Our works are not affected by floods. The stream is much more polluted than formerly. It is polluted by works above, but not, within our knowledge, by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells and brosehes; consume yearly about 6,000,000 gallons. Manufacture yearly 240,000 lbs. of goods and dye 12,000,000 lbs. of the value of 44,000l. Produce liquid refuse from washing 3,500,000; dyeing, 250,000, and soapsuds, 250,000 gallons. The whole of the waste liquid, except the soapsuds, flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly 40,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 45,000 lbs. of Gallipoli and olive oil of the value of 1,000l. Produce 8 tons of waste wool in carding; the greater portion of this is re-carded, and the refuse is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap 6 tons, alkali 6 tons, and urine 20,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 251l. a year. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. No suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

Obtain supply of water partly from the stream and partly from wells. Not able to state the annual consumption at our works. The water of the stream at present is clear enough for our use. We are not able to state the weight or the value of the goods manufactured or operated upon at our works. Produce liquid refuse amounting to 20,000 gallons, and soapsuds 6,000 gallons. We have no depositing tanks, and the waste liquid flows into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly as dye wares chiefly logwood, bi-chromate of potash, and Copperas 50,000 lbs. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of Â£1,000. The waste wool produced in carding is mixed with the excrements of our workpeople, and is used as manure on the land. Use yearly, soap about 10 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 25 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 600 tons of coal; make about 200 tons of ashes, which are used for repairing roads. Have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

I have depositing tanks, and pump the water after the wool scouring on the land, and the effluent water flows back into a reservoir for re-use. The other waste liquid flows into sewers, and is then conveyed on to land by farmers below for irrigation. Use yearly 70,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly dyewoods. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 4,800 gallons of olive oil, of the value of Â£1,080. The waste wool produced in carding is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly soap 4 tons, alkali 30 tons, and urine 15,000 gallons. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of my workpeople are used for manure.

Use yearly, 1 ton of tan, 15 tons, gambir or terra japonica 20 tons, sumac 5 tons, and fowl dung 2 tons. Do not use blood or human excrement. The hair obtained in depilation is thrown on to a manure heap. Obtain yearly 20 tons of fatty matter in the process of fleshing, which is made into size. Have 60 tanpits, 5 feet square, and 4 feet deep. Do not use any dye wares. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my tanyard flows direct into the stream. Use steam, 4 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 80 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of my workpeople are used for manure. No suggestions to offer.",

Consume about 2,500,000 gallons from waterworks, but are not able to tell the consumption from the other sources of supply.

Do not use any bleaching materials, oil, soap, alkali or urine. Use steam, 160 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly upwards of 3,000 tons of coal; make 750 tons of ashes, which are carted away for ballast to railways. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by the town sewers into the river.

The condition of the stream is gradually getting worse year by year. It is seriously polluted by refuse from towns and works above. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river and boreholes, and consume yearly 61,320,000 gallons.

Use yearly, as dyewares, indigo 70,000 lbs., barwood 44,300 lbs., and Sander's wood 20,000 lbs. Do not use any bleaching materials or oil. Use yearly, soap 18,000 lbs., and urine 15,000 gallons. Use steam, 10 nominal horse-power, and boilers 52 horse-power. Consume yearly, 1,800 tons of coal. Make 300 tons of ashes, which are used for ballast on railways and deposited on rubbish heaps.

I dye yearly 200,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 60,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works flows direct into the river. Use yearly 20 tons of dye wares, principally indigo, and red dye. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials, soap, or alkali. Use yearly, urine 4,000 gallons. Use steam, 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,400 tons of coal; make 300 tons of ashes, which are carted away and deposited to fill up old excavations. The excrements of my workplace are paid by a contractor to the Corporation.

Obtain supply of water jointly from the river, and from Waterworks Company; but do not know the annual consumption at our works. If the river, from which we might derive a supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of 201l. a year. Manufacture yearly 600 tons of goods, of the value of 25,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use steam, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carried away and used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into sewers, and thence into the river. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers should be prevented from turning their solid and liquid refuse into rivers and streams, and that town sewage should be kept out of them. We have no special suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

It is considerably polluted by every kind of manufacturing refuse, and by town sewage. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river, wells, boreholes, and from waterworks, and consume yearly from 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 gallons. With our present resources, if the river were rendered clean and colourless, it would be of little or no value to us. We tan yearly 10 tons of hides, and make 25 tons of leather. Use yearly, lime 9 tons, bark, valonia, shavings, gambir, terra japonica, and gall nuts 2 tons. Use pigeonsâ and dogsâ dung, but do not know the quantity; also bran, oatmeal, and salt, but do not know the quantity of each. Obtain 10,000 to 15,000 bushels of hair in the process of depilation, the greater part is sold for manure turning yarns for carpets, and the remainder is used on our own farm for manure. Obtain yearly 15 tons of hides, which are converted into glue. We have 359 tanpits, 7 feet 6 by 6 feet by 6 feet. Do not use any dye wares. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use steam, 600 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away for levelling up hollow spaces in land. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manuring our own land.

The beck has silted up considerably, partly from manufacturing refuse, and partly from town sewage. Our works are occasionally flooded, caused by the silting up of the bed of the stream. The Sheeps Carr Beck was 40 or 50 years ago pure and clear, and dyers, whose works were situated on its banks, washed their scarlet, crimson, and other bright-colored cloths, by throwing them into the stream; they were then producing colours of superior brilliancy. Small fish abounded in the stream at that time; but since then it has gradually become more and more polluted, and is now so filthy and black as to be almost unfit for any purpose whatever. Some portion, however, of the Beck has lately been very much improved by confining the stream in a narrow channel; and the bed has been paved, which has to some extent cured the evil of silting up. Solid matters thrown into it are more rapidly carried away by a flood. The Town Council have lately obtained parliamentary powers to carry out and further extend improvement in the bed of the beck for a length of two miles. We obtain supply of water from the stream, from wells, and from waterworks; but it is not at all clear. We make very little difference to us, as we obtain the chief part of our supply from wells. We use and produce very common 150 tons, indigo 20 tons, oil of vitriol 30 tons, copperas 30 tons, ammonia 40 tons, and lime 60 tons. Produce refined indigo 10,000 lbs., extract of indigo 150 tons, cudbear 120 tons, cochineal liquid 100 tons, and soap, 100 tons. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works is thrown into the stream. Use steam, 46 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 3,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away. We suggest that the beds of rivers flowing through towns should be paved, in a manner similar to the works now being carried on in the Sheeps Carr Beck. If refuse from manufacturers and sewage of towns must necessarily be thrown into rivers and streams, the plan now being carried out in Sheeps Carr Beck of paving the bed and forming an invert in the channel, is perhaps the best plan of mitigating the worst evils, which generally result from the practice of throwing polluted materials into streams; as by this means all the solid refuse matters are carried away by the stream with much more rapidity than formerly, and before they have time to enter putrefaction or decay.",

Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 10 tons of olive oil, of the value of 560l. Produce nearly 26 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap 6 tons, and alkali 6 tons, but no urine.

The bed of the Beck is paved, and an invert formed, which has very much improved the condition of it. Our works are affected by floods, but only at the time of heavy floods. The Beck is polluted by refuse from works and ashes thrown into it from above, and is very foul indeed. Obtain supply of water jointly from the stream and from waterworks, but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. If the stream, from which we might derive a supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of from 15l. to 20l. a year. Manufacture yearly 20,800 lbs. of goods, of the value of from 7,000l. to 8,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the Beck. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 12 to 14 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, a portion of which is sold to oil and grease extractors, and the remainder of this refuse is sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 4 tons, and alkali 4 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into the sewers. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all polluting materials should be kept out of rivers and streams.",

The bed of the beck is polluted by liquid refuse from manufacturers and works above, and partly from wells and boreholes, and consume yearly 112,800 gallons. When the water of the Beck is free from solid matter, it is suited for my trade purposes. I scribble and spin yearly 200,000 lbs. to 30,000 lbs. of goods. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works flows into the beck. My dye-house is let to J. Musgrove. Cannot tell the quantity of dye wares he uses. The spent liquid dye stuffs are carried into the Beck, the solid portion is burnt. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 300 gallons of Gallipoli oil. The better portion of the waste wool produced in carding is used again, the remainder is sold to mungo dealers. Do not use soap or alkali; use yearly, urine 3,100 gallons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use yearly, steam 58 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away to form new streets. The excrements of my workplace are conveyed into cesspools and carted away by a contractor under the Corporation. I suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all manufacturers should be compelled to keep their solid and liquid refuse out of the streams.",

Obtain a supply of water from the springs, but do not know the annual consumption at my tanyard. I tan yearly 520 tons of hides, and make 260 tons of leather. Use yearly, lime 52 tons, gambir 104 tons, flows' dung 1 cwt, salt 12 cwt, alum 12 cwt, tallow 8 cwt, and cod oil 3 tons. Obtain yearly in the process of depilation 2 tons of hair, which is sold to planters, and 4 tons of fatty matter in the process of fleshing, which is sold to size boilers. Have eight tanpits, 3 feet by 6 feet. I occasionally use dye wares, but am not able to state the quantity I use yearly. All the fluid refuse produced at the tanyard is conveyed by a pipe on to land, where it is used for irrigation. Consume yearly 15 tons of coal, the ashes from which are mixed with the excrements and used for manure. I have no suggestions to offer.",

Opposite works the bed of the river has silted up very considerably; 40 years ago the bed was was 5 or 6 feet deeper than at present, and the silting up to this great depth has been caused by ashes and rubbish thrown in by manufacturers and others. Formerly trout were very plentiful in the stream, but now no living thing can exist except rats, which feed on the dead carcases of animals thrown in. The river for more than half a mile above my works is very seriously polluted by town sewage and refuse from mills, manufactories, and works; and in the summer the stench is so bad the smell is perceptible for more than half a mile off. Obtain a supply of water from the river for manufacturing purposes; but do not know the annual consumption at my works. If the river were rendered clearer and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to me. I manufacture yearly 100 tons of goods, of the value of 25,000. The whole of the soapuds produced at my works flow into a tank; the other waste liquid produced flows direct into the sewers, and hence into the river. I do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 4 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 200. Do not use the wood I use. Use yearly, soap 90 packs, soda 1 ton, but no urine. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which I gain 201 yearly. Use steam (seven months in the year) and water as power, 46 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 300 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of my workplace are used for manure. I suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that every manufacturer should be compelled to filter the waste liquid produced at his works before allowing it to flow into the streams, that solid refuse should be kept out of the streams, and that town sewage should be utilized. Keighley is very excellently situated for conveying the sewage to land; but if the polluted water is turned away on to land, and prevented from flowing past my mill, I shall be deprived of water power, and the public will have to pay me compensation for it. Every person to whom a list of the queries is sent ought to answer them fairly, but I know that they do not intend to do it in this district, because they pollute the river. One firm in particular pollutes the river, and makes the water milky white for more than a mile in length, and this in summer time is most unbearable.

The condition of the stream has very little altered within our knowledge. The Beck is not polluted by works above, nor by mines. Obtain our supply of water jointly from the stream and from wells; but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, 700 tons of goods of the value of 60,000l. We produce yearly, liquid refuse and soapuds, 650,000 gallons, this refuse flows into depositing tanks, the whole of the other waste liquid produced flows into the river. We do not use either dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, 15 tons of olive oil, of the value of 800l. The whole of the waste wood produced in carding is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap 30 tons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 401 yearly. Use steam, 90 nominal horse-power. Consume 2,729 tons of coal yearly, the ashes from which are carted to the railway and used as ballast. The excrements of our workplace are used for manure. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future to begin at once and keep out all solid matter, then follow up by keeping out the waste liquid refuse produced by manufacturers, then take up impure contributions of every kind. Immense damage has been done to our stream since the commencement of the inquiry now instituted by the Rivers Pollution Commission, and all local authorities are delayed waiting for a full report. For the conservancy of rivers and streams, an official to undertake prosecutions will be necessary; probably if appointed by government, would give the greatest satisfaction; but the local governing bodies ought to have power to take action required.",

Our works are not affected by floods. The present condition of the streams is much better than it was 20 years ago. The streams are polluted by tanners to a slight extent, and also to a considerable extent by the washing of cinders and ashes from the surface of the roads in heavy rains. They are not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from the streams, wells, boreholes, and springs; but cannot tell the annual consumption of our works; we use in the manufacture of our goods 1,248,000 lbs. of wool yearly. We have depositing tanks, and filter the waste liquid from our dye works, and dye works, the effluent water from which flows direct into the streams. Use yearly 30 tons of dye stuffs, chiefly logwood, alum, argols, blue vitriol, fustic, coppers, and ammonia. The spent dye stuffs are mixed with the excrements of our workpeople. We do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 4,000 gallons of olive and Gallic oil, of the value of 1,000l. We produce about 3,000 lbs. of waste wool in the process of carding which are sold. We use yearly 15 tons of Price's oil soap, 21 tons of best Gallic oil soap, 15 tons of London curd soap, and 15 tons of soda ashes. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, and we gain 3,001l. a year by the extraction. Use both steam and water as power; steam 500 and water 23 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly for steam boilers and for gas making 6,600 tons of coal. Make about 1,500 tons of ashes, which are carted on to our premises to form filters for the grease extracting process and the liquid refuse from our dye works. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

The stream is not polluted by works above; nor by mines. Obtain a supply of water jointly from the stream and springs, but we are unable to give approximately the volume of water used yearly at our works. Manufacture goods to the value of 120,000l. The whole of the waste liquid refuse produced at our works flows into the stream. Do not use any dyewares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, Gallipoli oil, of the value of 200l.; soap, 9 tons; and alkali, 9 tons. The soap is treated for the recovery of the grease, which by the gain 30l. a year. Use steam, 48 nominal horse-power. Consume 1,600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workplace are carted away and used for manure. We have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

Produce yearly, liquid refuse, as soapsuds, 900,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks; the other liquid refuse produced flows into the river. Do not use dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, olive oil (but the water is not fouled by it, as it is all used in the other process), of the value of 500L. Do not produce any waste wood. Use yearly, soap 200 packs; the soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain from 35L. to 40L. a year. Use steam, 60 nominal horse-power. Consume about 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used partly to repair roads and partly to fill up an old quarry. The excrements of our workpeople are collected in tanks, and taken away to be used as manure on our own land.

The bed of the stream has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods. The channel of the stream is sometimes dry, and at other times a fair volume of water flows down. The river has been much in the same condition for the last 50 years. The river is so fearfully polluted that the water is unfit for use, except after a very heavy flood; it is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells, bore holes, and sometimes from the stream, when clear. Consume yearly from bore holes 15,000,000 gallons, and from Beck 750,000 gallons. As we have a good supply of water from our wells we should not use the Beck water to any extent, even if it were rendered clear and colourless. We manufacture yearly 1,040,000 lbs. of goods of the value of 174,000. Produce yearly liquid refuse from soapsuds 3,000,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks; the other waste liquids produced at our works flow directly into the Beck. We do not use either dye waters or bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,000. Produce yearly 52,000 lbs. of waste wool in carding which is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly 100 tons of soap, but no alkali or urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain from 80l. to 90l. a year. Use steam, 135 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 4,500 tons of coal, and make about 800 tons of ashes, which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Spin yearly 96,000 lbs. of five, and weave 156,000 lbs. of yarn. The waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye waters, bleaching materials, soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam, 17 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 780 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure.

Our works are not affected by floods by reason of the contraction of the channel of the Beck, where covered over above our works. The condition of the stream becomes seriously affected during the year. It is seriously polluted by town sewage and refuse from dye and other works; it is as noisome as possible, and the temperature of the water is raised, by being constantly used for manufacturing processes to from 80âÃ Ã» to 90âÃ Ã» Fahrenheit; it is not potable in any degree. Obtain supply of water jointly from wells and from water-works; we consume yearly about 9,000,000 gallons. If the stream from which we might derive our supply of water were rendered clean and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of 230Â£ a year. We manufacture yearly about 2,500,000 lbs. of wool of the value of 200,000Â£. Produce yearly liquid refuse, as soapuds, 1,200,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks, but either the waste liquid refuse flows direct into the stream. Do not use other waste liquids or bleaching materials. Use yearly 12 tons of olive oil, of the value of 600Â£. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is used for manure. Use yearly, soap 1 ton, alkali 400 cwts, but in time. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 250 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 4,200 tons of coal; the ashes from the coals are used in making mortar for building purposes; and the remainder is tipped into old quarries, or used as ballast by the railway company. Two-thirds of the excrements of our workpeople are used for manure, and the remainder is cast into the Beck. Have no suggestions to offer.",

My hands are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has not changed within the last 10 years. It is polluted by works above, but not by mines. I obtain a supply of water from the reservoirs of Messrs. Edward Piggott, but have never measured the volume consumed at my works yearly. If the stream were rendered clean and colourless it would be of money value to me of 50l. a year. I manufacture yearly 400,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 60,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse, as soupads, 200,000 gallons; these flow into depositing tanks, but the other liquid refuse produced flows direct into the river. Do not use dyes or bleaching materials. Use yearly 480 gallons of olive oil, of the value of 120l. Produce yearly 10,000 lbs. of waste wool, in carding, which is sold to clothiers. Use yearly soap, 20,000 lbs. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 20l. a year. Use steam, 55 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,500 tons of coal. Make 250 tons of ashes, which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed by farmers in the night-time, and used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

It is impossible fitly to describe the fearfully polluted state of this Beck. It has always been within our knowledge, and is now, black and filthy, and is polluted to the fullest extent possible. Obtain supply of water from wells and from the Corporation waterworks, and consume, yearly 96,000,000 gallons. We finish about 800 pieces daily from 6d. to 1s. 6d. per piece. We dye daily 2,500 pieces black, at 1s. per piece; also in slubbing (which is wool already reserved for the spinner) 600 lbs. from 1s. 1d. to 1s. 2d. per lb., and 2,000 lbs. of cotton in various colours at 1s. 0d. to 2s. 6d. per lb. We print daily 240 lbs. of worsted from 1s. 0d. to 1s. 6d. per lb. Produce 52,944,000 lbs. of liquid refuse from washing, printing, and dyeing, which flows direct into the Beck. Use yearly as dye wares, raged wool 1,560,000 lbs., 1,048,320 lbs., fustic 34,736 lbs., pecan 7,876 lbs., chrome 419,328 lbs., chloride of lime 26,480 lbs., sulphuric acid 36 lbs., bromo 53,760 lbs., spirits of salts 26,732 lbs., ammonia 28,033 lbs., aniline 1,376 lbs., extract of indigo 80,572 lbs., cochineal 10,752 lbs., indigo 6,518 lbs., soda ash 79,440 lbs., sulphate of copper 6,376 lbs. The spent woods are burned under our boilers. Use yearly as bleaching materials 26,480 lbs. of chloride of lime, and 79,440 lbs. of soda and bleaching powder. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, about 350 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 24,258 tons of coal, the ashes from which are piled in a heap, and used for building purposes by ourselves, and any one who likes to fetch them. None are put into the stream.

Obtain supply of water from wells sunk to about 60 yards, from bore-holes below the coal workings, and a small quantity from springs; and consume yearly, 450,000,000 gallons. The whole of the water consumed, viz., 450,000,000 gallons, after being used for dyeing and washing purposes, is discharged into the Beck. We have depositing tanks for our own convenience, and the water they contain is used for condensing purposes at the mills situated below our works. We use yearly from 800 to 900 tons of woods and other solid dye-wares, 400 to 500 tons of alum, 100 tons of potash, soda, sulphate of copper, ammonia, glauber salts, and soap. We also use 400 tons of sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids. The soapsuds cannot be separated in our operations, and therefore cannot be treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, about 1,000 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 21,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used principally as ballast for railways. The excrements of our workpeople are collected, and used as manure on land. I do not see how pollution can be avoided in our case, except by stopping our works. Have no suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams, as it is a difficult question to be dealt with.",

Obtain supply of water jointly from bore-holes, and from waterworks of the Bradford Corporation, which I might derive my supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, I should not be able to use it profitably, as the supply is uncertain. I bleach and dye yearly 2,500,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 190,000l. to 200,000l. About one-third of the water used is filtered; but the remainder is only slightly polluted. I have no depositing tanks; the whole of the waste flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 900,000 lbs. of dye woods, drugs, and aniline colours. All the spent stuffs are mixed with the coal and burned. Use yearly as bleaching materials, sulphuric acid, chloride of lime 9,000 lbs.; do not use any oil. Use yearly, soap 500 packs. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease by a recipe, and I receive an equivalent in water. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power.

My works are not affected by floods. The Beck is arched over near the works and is very much polluted by works above. Obtain supply of water from the Bradford Corporation Waterworks, and consume yearly about 800,000 gallons. If the stream from which we might derive our supply of water were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct yearly value to me of 30/-. I print yearly 70,000 lbs. of yarn, the value of Â£12,000. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the Beck. Use yearly as dye liquor, 5,000 lbs.; iron and red liquor, 200 lbs.; and 800 lbs. yearly bleaching materials; chloride of lime, 1,680 lbs.; soda ash, 560 lbs.; vitriol, 2,000 lbs. Do not use any soap, or urine, but yearly, alkali, a quarter of a ton. Use steam, 2 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 15 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used in the streets.

Obtain supply of water from the Bradford Corporation waterworks, and consume yearly 1,090,000 gallons. We, yearly, size goods of the value of from 4,000 to 5,000.

Use steam, 10 nominal horse-power. Consume 864 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used partly in paving the roads and mortar.

We hire power and power, and our landlord pays rates and supplies the water for our consumption, we are unable to give the quantity used yearly. If the river, from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to us. We manufacture yearly goods 360,000 lbs. Produce yearly, liquid refuse, as soap suds, 2,470,000 gallons. This and the whole of the other waste liquid produced flows direct into Bradford Beck. We do not use other liquid wares or bleaching materials, but use yearly 30 gallons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 811, also soap 35 packs, and soda ash 6 cwt. The soap suds are not treated for the recovery of grease. As we only hire power from Messrs. S. Sutcliffe and Sons, who are joint occupiers with us, we are unable to state the nominal steam power, the quantity of coal used, what is done with the ashes, or what is done with the excrements of our workpeople.

The stream is seriously polluted by town sewage and liquid refuse from manufacturers and works above; not to our knowledge from mines. Obtain supply of water from stream and springs. Manufacture yearly, 80 tons of goods of the value of 16,000. Produce yearly, liquid refuse, as soap suds, 150,000 gallons; this flows into depositing tanks. The other waste liquid produced flows direct into the Beck. Do not use dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 600 gallons of olive and sperm oil, of the value of 150. Do not produce any waste wool. Use yearly, soap 50 packs. The soap suds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 151 yearly. We rent power, and therefore are unable to state the horse-power used, the quantity of coal consumed, or what is done with the ashes.

Use yearly, soap, 20,800 lbs; alkali 1,747,720 lbs.; and urine 104,000 gallons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain yearly 15l.

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused partly by ashes and soil refuse thrown into it by the people living on its banks. Our works are slightly affected by floods. Fourteen years ago the stream was of a dark colour, but every year it has become gradually worse until now it is quite black. It is polluted by works above and by sewage, but not by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells, and consume yearly about 2,400,000 gallons. If the river were rendered clear, it would be a direct money value to us of 30l yearly. Manufacture yearly, 80 tons of goods, of the value of 26,000. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct, unfiltered, into the stream. Use yearly as dye wares, 72,000 lbs of wood, barwood, fustic, camwood, madder, and alum, copas and bi-chrome. The spent dye stuffs are mostly burned, the remainder is carted away for agricultural purposes, and the spend dye stuff is thrown into the Beck. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 16 tons of olive and rape oil, of the value of 700. Produce yearly, 12 tons of waste wool in the process of carding. Use yearly, soap 5 tons; sod, 6 tons; and urine, 130 tons. The grease is partly extracted from the soapsuds, we sell the soapsuds for 71 a year. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly, 800 tons of coal, make about 80 tons of ashes, which are carted away for the repair of roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed by farmers for agricultural purposes.

It has not been, to my knowledge, polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from wells, bore-holes, and springs. We are not able to give the annual consumption at our works, but we use a very considerable volume. If the stream ran colourless, it would be of very great importance to us, but we are unable to fix the money value. We manufacture yearly, 150 tons of goods, of the value of 45,000. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct unfiltered into the stream. We use dye wares 26,000 lbs. of logwood, fustic, and barwood. The spent dye stuffs are partly burned and partly carted away to repair roads. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 24 tons of grease and Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,000. Produce 31,200 lbs. of waste wool in carding, which is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, 2 tons, alkali & soap, and 500 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 20. Use steam, 35 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal.

Use yearly, 100 tons of dye wares, chiefly dye woods. The spent dye liquors are run into the river, the spent dye stuffs are carted to old quarries. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 50 tons of Gallipoli and Price's patent cloth oil, of the value of 2,500l. The wool produced in carding is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap 12 tons, alkali 40 tons, and urine 32,500 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 30l. a year. Use steam, 40 nominal horse-power.

The bed of the Beck is almost filled up with ashes and spent dye woods charged into it above our works. We have found it necessary to form two depositing tanks for the river water to be usable before we are able to use it for engine and boiler purposes. Our works are affected by floods. The condition of the stream has not changed within our observation for the last 10 or 12 years; it is polluted to such a very serious extent that we can only use it for engine and boiler purposes, and then only after settling. It is gradually becoming worse; it is also polluted by mines. Obtain our supply of water jointly from the river and stream, surface drainage, and a well; and consume for washing purposes from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 gallons. If the river stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable money value to us, and it would enable us probably to increase our trade. We manufacture yearly from 50 to 60 tons of goods, of the value of from 30,000l. to 40,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 3,000,000 gallons, and 2,000,000 gallons from the whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Use yearly about 1 ton of dye wares, chiefly dye woods. The refuse dye stuffs are burnt. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly from 15 to 20 tons of oil, of the value of 1,000l. Produce yearly about 8 tons of waste wood for the process of carding, which is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap 5 tons, and 130 tons of ammonia and alkali from 3 to 4 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam as nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are being stored up for future use. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. In this neighbourhood pollution of the streams are used to continue so long as refuse from mills, dry houses, town yards and pits as well as the sewage of the town are discharged into them.",

Our works are affected by floods. There has been no change in the condition of the river within our knowledge. Seven years ago the Beck was a clear stream; it is now very considerably polluted both by works above and by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the Beck, wells, and boreholes, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. If the stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us now, as we have obtained a splendid supply of good water from wells and boreholes sunk on our premises, and therefore should require the Beck water for washing purposes. Manufacture yearly 156,800 lbs. of goods, of the value of 11,760l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. We do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 15 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 70l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works is re-used, with the exception of 5 tons of worst refuse, which is sent to the manure in the yards. Use yearly, soap 5 tons, and 150 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are removed away for repairing roads and footpaths. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We suggest the best means of avoiding pollution in future that refuse from manufacturers and mines should not be allowed to be turned into rivers and streams.",

Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the streams is very dirty - but not perceptibly more so than it was 20 years ago. They are polluted by refuse from mills, tanneries, quarries, and mines; the water is very offensive in summer time. We obtain supply of water jointly from the wells, and from surface drainage; but are unable to give the quantity of water consumed yearly at our works; it is a very large quantity. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would not affect us very materially in money value. We are unable to state the quantity of goods manufactured by us yearly. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, excepting soap-suds, flows direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly, 61,262 lbs. of dyewares, as logwood, camwood, barwood, fustic, argol, Sander's, madder, alum, copperas, and bi-chrome, cubebs, aniseed, and other copperas. The spent dyestuffs are burned. Use yearly, 7,500 gallons of bleach liquor, value of 1,500l. Produce yearly 1,100 tons of wool in the process of carding; the best of it is re-used, and the remainder is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap, 11 tons; alkali, 5 tons; urine, 80 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease; by which we gain seven guineas a year. Use steam, 2,600 nominal horse-power. Consume nearly 2,600 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Use yearly 10 tons of dyewares, chiefly logwood. The spent dyestuff is conveyed into sewers, and thence into the river. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 20 tons of Gallic acid and olive oil, of the value of 1,100l. Produce yearly, about 8 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which are sold to grease extractors. Use yearly, soap 5 tons, and urine 30,000 gallons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 36 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly, 1,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away to be used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the river has silted up very much more than a foot during the last four years, being at present nearly level with the roadway. This has been caused by the great quantity of ashes, cinders, and dross daily thrown into the river from mills and iron works in the town; also from gravel and stone brought down from the hill sides in time of flood, which latter cannot be washed away owing to weirs forming obstructions in the river bed. In 1868 a very destructive flood occurred, and we sustained a damage of more than 500l., since which time our works have been upon two or three occasions affected by floods. The river is polluted to a slight extent by works above, and it is seriously polluted by works below us, and by mines. We obtain a supply of water from the river, but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly 10 tons of goods, of the value of 20,000l. The liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use steam, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carried to fill up hollow places on land adjoining the mill. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into sewers, and thence into the river. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers should be prevented from turning ashes and solid refuse into the stream. There is a large tract of land in this neighbourhood upon which, for a charge of 2d. a load, ashes might be deposited; and the owners of such land require the refuse for levelling up hollow places.",

The bed of the river has silted up near our works, and we attribute the cause of it to the Brothers' chemical works, and also to ashes and refuse thrown in by millowners at Sowerby Bridge (in defiance of the Act of Parliament) which are washed down by floods. These (Canal) mills are situated considerably above the level of the river, but at Meanwood Mills the dam for the water-wheel is constantly silting up from the before-mentioned cases. We obtained an injunction against Messrs. Norris some years ago, to restrain them from casting refuse into the river; but it is now hard to amend a letter. The river is very seriously polluted by all kinds of manufacturing refuse, and by sewage, the water being always in a filthy state, especially in the summer, when the effluvia arising from it is almost unbearable. The water in the river then flows almost stagnant in pools, but periodical floods wash it away, and to some extent purify the bed of the stream. Obtain supply of water principally from the river, but in very droughty seasons from the river; consume yearly about 1,300,000 gallons. If the river were rendered cleaner and colourless it would be of considerable money value to us, but we are not able to fix. the amount. Manufacture yearly 650 tons of goods, of the value of 130,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Use yearly 270 tons of dye wares, chiefly lace-dye, cochineal, indigo, log and other woods, tar and argols. The whole of the spent dye wares and liquids flow into the river. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 50 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 2,750l. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is sold, and used for the manufacture of the coarser articles. Use yearly, soap 70 tons, but no alkali or urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 80l. a year. Use steam, 300 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 5,000 tons of coal, the ashes of which are carted to a heap near to our manufactory. The excrements of our workpeople are removed from the works every fortnight to a manure heap, mixed with solid refuse and shoddy, and then used for agricultural purposes. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all liquid refuse from bleach, chemical, dye, and other works should be filtered before being passed into streams; that a very heavy fine be inflicted upon all persons throwing these polluting materials, and also solid refuse of any kind, into streams; and that an officer should be appointed to prosecute all persons committing these offences.",

The waste wool produced in carding is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly, soap and alkali 12 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 7 nominal horse-power, but as I rent power I am not able to state what quantity of coal is consumed, or what is done with the ashes.

Use yearly 28 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,550l. Use yearly 193 tons of soap; no alkali or urine. The aspsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 1,500l. a year. Use steam, 350 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 10,260 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for mixing with lime for building purposes, and also for repairing roads. The excrements of our workplace are removed from the premises and used as manure. No suggestions to offer.",

Our works are not affected by floods. 50 years ago the Hebble was a pure stream; it is now much polluted, and after its junction with the Oeenden Brook seriously so. The Hebble is not polluted by refuse from mines, but the Oeenden Brook is. Obtain supply of water jointly from river, from wells, bore-holes, and from waterworks; but it is quite impossible to estimate the annual consumption at our works. If the river or stream from which we might derive a supply of water were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us; but it is difficult to estimate the amount. We manufacture yearly 5,160 tons of goods, of the value of 900,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse from our works flows directly into the stream. Use yearly all kinds of dyes and wares, but are not able to give the weight. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 75 tons of oil, of the value of 3,900l. Produce yearly 5 tons of waste wool in carding, which is sold to other manufacturers. Use yearly, soap 312 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, from 400 to 500 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 24,000 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted away to a \"tip,\" or ground provided for that purpose. The excrements of our workpeople are removed in carts from tanks provided for their reception. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, and for the conservancy of rivers and streams, that inspectors in the form of the police should be duly appointed.",

Obtain our supply of water jointly from rivers, wells, and Corporation Waterworks, and consume at the works at Copley, for gas powering and wool washing, 939,420 gallons yearly. We are unable to state the quantity consumed at our works at Haley Hill. If the water of the streams was rendered chemically pure, it would be of considerable money value to us, but simply decolorized it would be of great grain to us. We are unable to give the weight and value of the goods operated upon at our works, as we cannot separate the goods manufactured or operated upon, either wholly or in part. The goods are sold when combined with or even formed of materials bought, not separated upon. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows into the sewers, and thence into the rivers Calder and Hebble. Do not use any dyewares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, 65 tons of oil of the value of 2,640l. Produce about two tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold. Use yearly, soap, 15 tons; alkali, 15 tons; but no urine or ammonia. The soapsuds are sold to grease extractors. Use both steam and water as power, steam, 1,180, and water, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 6,300 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed partly through the town sewers to the river, and partly carted away by farmers in the neighborhood to be used for manure. We do not see any means at present for avoiding pollution in future without interfering with the district, but we would suggest that all solid matters should be kept out of rivers and streams. The formation of reservoirs at the heads of rivers and streams, for storing flood water and allowing the water to flow in times of drought down the river channels, seems to us the most feasible plan of ameliorating pollution.",

Do not use either dye wares or bleaching flows direct into the stream. Use yearly, olive oil, 5,500 gallons, of the value of 1,200l. Use yearly, soap, 200 packs; soda, 30 cwt.; no urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 700 tons of coal; make 300 tons of ashes, which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed into tanks, and are afterwards mixed with other refuse and used for manure. No suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by refuse thrown in from works and houses above. Our works are affected by floods, and in 1856 suffered very considerable damage. The river is at present a filthy stream, although some four years ago it was very clear. It is polluted by dye and other works above to such an extent that we are now obliged to cleanse out the goit which supplies our works six or eight times in the course of a year. It is not polluted, to our knowledge, by mines. Obtain supply of water from the stream. Owing to the polluted state of the water we are not able to scour our goods at the works. If the water was clear and colourless we should be glad to do so, and it would be a very considerable gain to us, although we are not able to fix the amount. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dyes or bleaching materials. Use yearly 4 tons of rape oil, of the value of 160l.; 1.73 tons of cloth oil, of the value of 660l.; and 33 gallons of olive oil, of the value of 81l. Produce yearly 12 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil extractors. Do not use either soap, alkali, or urine. Use both steam and water as power; steam 28, and water 8, nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed by farmers for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Our works are not affected by floods. Some years ago the water of the river was sufficiently clean to wash goods in it; it is now so much polluted by works above and by town sewage as to be really unfit for that purpose. Obtain supply of water for condensing purposes from the river, and for dyeing, from wells, and for scouring from Corporation Waterworks. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, for which we might derive a supply of water, it would be of value for more than 1000 a year. We dye, stove, and finish 450 tons of goods yearly. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly 143,000 lbs. of dye stuffs, principally ground logwood, fustic, and shumae; part of the spent dye stuffs is burnt and the remainder is used for manure. Use 2,250 lbs. of bleaching materials, chiefly brimstone, but occasionally use chloride of lime. Use yearly, soap 20,000 lbs., ammonia 39,000 lbs. The soap suds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 12 nominal horse power. Consume yearly 3,000 tons of coal, and about 300 tons of ashes, which are carted away to be used for manure. The excrements of our workplace are also carted away by farmers to be used for agricultural purposes. No suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the stream has not silted up within our knowledge. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream is much the same as when we first knew it. It is polluted by works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from river and from waterworks; consume yearly 3,130,000 gallons. If the river were rendered clear and colourless it would make but very little difference to us. We dye yearly 572 tons of goods. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing, 1,043,383; from dyeing, 1,565,000; and from soap, 521,667 gallons. Have no depositing tanks. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows directly into the stream. Use yearly, as dyes, indigo 8,162 lbs., indigo extract 14,756, aniline 960, dye woods 71,388, dye wood extract 8,336, rich liquor 21,528, cochineal 6449, cudbear 3,693, madder 2,296, picric acid 2,294, sulphuric acid 73,953, oxalic acid 3,777, ammonia 5,341, bi-chrome 9,210, alum 56,000, argol 2,836, scarlet spirit 6,661, muriate of tin 3,855, and ammonia 2,104 lbs. The spent dye stuffs are burned. The liquid refuse produced at our works is conveyed into the stream. Use yearly, as bleaching materials, sulphur 2,240 lbs. Do not use any. Use yearly, soft soap, 7 tons; soda, 10 tons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 14 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away to railways for ballast. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Obtain supply of water chiefly from wells and boreholes, but partly from Waterworks Company. Do not know the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly 300,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 70,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the stream. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials, soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam, 10 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 250 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into sewers, and thence into the stream. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers should be compelled to return the liquid refuse produced at their works into rivers and streams, not containing more than a certain standard of impurity, and that town sewage should be kept out of rivers and streams.",

The bed of the river has silted up, caused by the pouring in of sewage by the Corporation and mill owners, also by ashes, dyewares, and other filth thrown into the stream. Our works are affected by floods, and considerable damage is often done to them. Within our recollection the stream has comparatively pure; now it is nothing better than disgusting swamps, polluted by every kind of manufacturing refuse, and by town sewage; but we are not aware whether it is polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the stream, canal, wells, and Corporation waterworks. Our consumption is very large, but are not able to state the volume used at our works. If the river or stream from which we might derive a supply of water were rendered clear and unpolluted, it would be of very great money value to us, and we use every year a considerable sum. We manufacture yearly goods of the value from 200,000l. to 250,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, with exception of soapsuds, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 50 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 2,500l. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is sold to woollen manufacturers. We use yearly, soap of the value of 1,000. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain yearly 120l. Use steam 240 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 7,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away from our premises. The excrements of our workpeople are partly carted away by farmers for manure, and are partly used on our own land. We see no means of avoiding pollution in future, that all solid and liquid refuse from manufactories, mills, and works, should be kept out of rivers and streams as far as practicable; that the turning in of this pollution be made known, and that the offender be fined on conviction. We have no special suggestions to offer as to the conservancy of rivers and streams, only that municipal corporations should not form a board of conservators.",

The bed of the stream near our works is almost dry, except in very rainy seasons; it has not silted up. Our works are not affected by floods; formerly there was a large volume of water flowing down the stream, but it has been diverted for the stone quarries. The river is not polluted by works above, nor by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river, from wells, and also from reservoirs formed by ourselves for impounding water, cannot give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, goods of the value of 160,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the stream, and the effluent water from the soapsuds also flows into the stream. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, 2,000 gallons of olive oil, of the value of about 440l. Use yearly about 150 packs of soap. The soapsuds are sold to a grease extractor, for which we receive 50l. a year. Use yearly, 1,500 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted away to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed and used for agricultural purposes. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that liquid and solid refuse from manufacturers and works should be conveyed into settling tanks, and sufficient time allowed for the matters held in suspension to deposit; and by the use of several of these tanks (the liquid flowing from one into the other), seven-eighths of the pollution would, in our opinion, be arrested and prevented from passing into the river or stream. In manufacturers or works where there is little room for the construction of tanks, several millowners or proprietors, whose works are situated on the same stream, might combine together, and settling tanks might be formed below the lowest works to receive the liquid refuse from their several works.",

The river is very much polluted by refuse from dyehouses and wire mills; but not by mines. Obtain supply of water (jointly) from the stream, and from gathering ground; and consume yearly, 3,000,000 gallons. If the stream, from which I might derive my supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to me of 50l. a year. Manufacture 24,000 lbs., bleach 18,000 lbs., and 8,000 lbs. yearly of goods, of the value of 10,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye wares; but use as bleaching materials, 56 tons of sulphur. Use yearly, 600 gallons of olive oil, of the value of 100l. Produce yearly, 2,240 lbs. of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to growers for manure. Use yearly, soap 10 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we have gained 32l. per annum. Consume yearly, 60 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away to fill up a drain. The excrements of my workplace are used for manure. I suggest, in order to avoid pollution in future, that manufacturers and others should be compelled to purify their liquid refuse before allowing it to flow into the streams.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by ashes and other solid refuse thrown into it. Our works are not affected by floods, but the land adjoining to the works is occasionally flooded, caused by the silting up of the bed of the stream. The stream is seriously polluted by works above, and the water is rendered useless to us from that cause. Obtain supply of water from wells and bore-holes, and consume yearly, 62,000 gallons. If the stream from which we might derive our supply of water were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us, but we cannot estimate the amount. We dye 1,500,000 lbs. of goods yearly. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the Beck. Use yearly as dye wares, dyewoods, 470,000 lbs.; a glauber salt, 34,000 lbs.; soda ash, 6,500 lbs.; 3,000 lbs. of alum, 40,500 lbs.; 1 alum, 40,500 lbs.; bi-chrome, 11,200 lbs.; a lime, 5,000 lbs.; extract of indigo, 5,000 lbs.; and dye liquors, 122,000 lbs. The spent dye stuffs are partly burned. Use yearly 10 tons of bleaching lime, and 2 tons of soap. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 25 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. One-fifth of the excrements of our workpeople is conveyed into the Beck and four-fifths are used for manure. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future that all solid and liquid refuse should be taken out of rivers and streams, and that in manufacturing districts sewers should be constructed on each side of rivers and streams to intercept the sewage and liquid refuse. This refuse should be conducted to convenient places, passed through filter beds, and purified before being allowed to flow into rivers and streams; and also that a rate should be levied in the district for carrying out and maintaining this work.",

From the head of the valley at Lowmoor to Ravensthorpe, near Sawbury, there is a population of about 40,000 persons. One of the tributaries of the river Calder flows down this valley, receiving the drainage and pollutions of towns and various manufactories in connexion with them. Our large rivers are often more polluted by towns and villages on a tributary than by those on their banks. The river Spen, which flows very high, was so spoiled a variety of fish, at present has the appearance of ink, and in fact is the receptacle of every abomination. I trust that the Government will take the necessary steps to remove the evils arising from these pollutions, for I have not much faith in local authorities, especially in manufacturing districts; they are so accustomed to shirks. I think the agitation of our Corporation just now will end in nothing. If a bill is passed by the Government to form drainage districts, the Heckmondwike valley ought to be made into a separate one, for it has little to do with other portions of the neighborhood, except in polluting the Calder, and its connexion with Dewsbury and Batley in the waterworks.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by the ashes being placed across the stream at various points, which prevent the ashes and other solid refuse thrown in from being washed freely away in a time of flood. Our main works are situated at too high a level, but a portion of our works is affected by floods, caused by the silting up of the stream. The water of the stream is discoloured, but within the memory of persons of our workpeople, it was a pure stream containing fish. It is polluted chiefly by works above ours; it is partially polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from springs, wells, waterworks, and gathering grounds; but are not able to state the whole consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, goods of the value of 200,000l., print goods of the value of 20,000l., and dye goods of the value of 40,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the stream. We use yearly as dye wares, chipped logwood, 210,916 lbs., rasped limawood, 2,548 lbs.; peachwood, 57,323 lbs.; Sander's wood, 16,828 lbs.; fustic, 461,171 lbs.; cudbear, 9,225 lbs.; tar, or madder, 818 lbs.; flavine, 15,962 lbs.; myrobalans, 41,090 lbs.; lac dye, 10,026 lbs.; sumach, 4,286 lbs.; cochineal, 5,749 lbs.; turmeric, 20,779 lbs.; argol, 2,957 lbs.; bichrome, 8,926 lbs.; sulphate of iron, 12,508 lbs.; nitrate of iron, 25,325 lbs.; prussiate of copper, 872 lbs.; bi-carbonate of soda, 647 lbs.; album, 31,360 lbs.; prussiate of potash, 818 lbs.; extract of indigo, 14,449 lbs.; alum, 31,360 lbs.; grain, 13,136 lbs.; oxymuriate of tin, 4,928 lbs.; aniline colour, 1,000 lbs.; ammonia, 6,310 lbs.; logwood liquor, 21,716 lbs.; pieric acid (liquid), 6,134 lbs.; sammoniac, 100 lbs.; hydrochloric acid (liquid), 22,468 lbs.; muriatic acid, 7,916 lbs.; grain spirits, 13,835 lbs.; sapan liquor, 7,336 lbs.; blue liquor, 850 lbs.; yellow spirits, 13,635 lbs.; blue spirits, 6,514 lbs.; caustic liquor, 2,385 lbs., and diluted spirits, 3,814 gallons. The solid dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, soap 20 tons; soda ash, 62 tons; chloride of lime, 1 ton; and 18,286 gallons of urine. The soapsuds are created for the recovery of the grease, and we gain yearly 621 lbs. by the extraction. Use steam, 200 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 5,934 tons of coal, the ashes from which are ground and used in the manufacture of bricks. The excrements of our workpeople are removed from the premises by farmers, and used for manure. We consider that if the productions which cause pollution were dealt with and utilized in a comprehensive scheme it would be remunerative.",

The bed of the river has silted up, caused by ashes and other solid refuse thrown into it. Our works are affected by floods. In the summer of 1868 we lowered the bed of the Beck under the bridge 6 inches, to make room for the floods to pass off. The river is polluted by works above; we think not by mines. Obtain supply of water partly from the Beck and from the river, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. If the Beck, from which we might derive a supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of 201l. a year. Manufacture yearly 290,000 lbs. and dye 160,000 lbs. of goods of the value of 24,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into sewers, and thence into the beck. Use yearly 55,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood, peachwood, fustic, argols, cochineal, indigo, copperas, bi-chrome, prussic acid, and a variety of other spirits, ammonia, and blue spirits. The solid dye stuffs are burned, and the liquids flow into the beck. Use yearly as bleaching materials, 4 tons of solid brimstone, which is roygised. Consume yearly 1,201 lbs. of the value of 1,000l. The whole of the waste wood produced in carding is sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 20 tons, and 286,880 lbs. of soda crystals and soda ash. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are mixed with refuse and used for manure on our own land. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by solid and other refuse thrown into it. Our works are occasionally affected by floods. The river is polluted by works above, not by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells, and from stream; consume yearly, 33,726,000 gallons. If the stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of very little use to us, as we like the water of the stream better than the well water for boiler purposes. Manufacture yearly, 2,000 tons of goods, of the value of 70,000. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from soaps, dyeware, and suds, 33,726,000 gallons. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except the soapsuds, flows direct into sewers, and thence into the river. Use nearly 80 tons of dye wares; chiefly logwood, peachwood, fustic, aniline dyes, lac dye, and indigo. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 50 tons of Price's patent cloth oil, of the value of 2,000. The whole of the waste wood produced in carding is sold for manure. Use yearly, soft soap 10,500 lbs, and alkali 60,000 lbs. The soapsuds are sold to oil and grease extractors, by which we gain 15l. Use steam, 24 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,200 tons of coals, the ashes from which are used partly to repair roads, and partly to fill up an old quarry. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The river is polluted by works above, but we have no reason to complain of it; we are not aware that it is polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river, and consume yearly 30,000,000 gallons. Manufacture yearly, goods of the value from 200,000l. to 300,000l. The whole of the waste liquid, except soapsuds, produced at our works, flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dyes or bleaching materials. Use yearly 82 tons of olive, rap, and Price's patent cloth oil, of the value of 3,692. The greater part of the waste wood produced in carding is sold, the remainder is used for manure. Use yearly 25 tons of soap, 60 tons of alkali, and 500 tons of urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 100l. a year. Use steam, 100 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 3,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used chiefly to repair roads, none are thrown into the river. The excrements of our workplace are used for manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers and others should be compelled to prevent all solid refuse from flowing into rivers and streams. With regard to the conservancy of rivers and streams, we think it is a moonshine piece of business, that it would be of no practical use to the country, but would work immense injury to manufacturing interests.",

Obtain supply of water direct from the river. The goods we manufacture yearly weigh in the grease 2,100,000 lbs., and when scoured 1,400,000 lbs., and are of the value of 12,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use yearly 300,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood, fustic, barwood, and peachwood. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 90 tons of Gallipoli and Price's patent oil, of the value from 4,000l. to 5,000l. Produce yearly 100 tons of waste wood, which is sold to oil extractors. Use yearly soap 30 tons; alkali, 60 tons; and urine 80 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 120l. yearly. Use steam, 100 nominal horse-power. Generally 5,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are partly ground and mixed with lime for mortar, and partly used for filling up hollow places. The excrements of our workplace are used for manure.

Obtain supply of water for filling from wells and waterworks, and for steam boiler purposes from the stream; consume yearly from wells and waterworks 2,000,000 gallons. We operate yearly upon 478,000 lbs. of goods. Produce yearly 2,000,000 gallons of liquid refuse from scouring, which flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye woods or materials. Use yearly 1,100 gallons of oil and Price's patent oil, which is provided by the persons for wool and spin. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is sold for manure. Use yearly, fuller's earth 12 tons, soap 1 ton, alkali 2 tons, and urine 8,000 gallons. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,133 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used partly as ballast on railways and partly for the repair of roads. The excrements of our workpeople are mixed with the finer ashes and used for manure.

Rateable value of works at Batley Carr, 1,074l., 5s., and Ravensthorpe, 142l, 10s. The bed of Batley Carr Beck has silted up, causing the throwing in of ashes and other solid refuse. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the streams gradually becomes worse year by year. They are polluted by works above and by mines. Obtain supply jointly from streams, from wells, and from waterworks. We keep no account of the quantity consumed at Batley Carr, but at Ravensthorpe consume yearly 35,640,000 gallons. Manufacture yearly 480,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of Â£90,000. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing, 4,500,000; from dyeing, 4,500,000; from soap suds, 360,000; and from seak, 850,000. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soaps and seak, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly as dye woods, logwood, 89,690 lbs.; barwood, 5,600 lbs.; tin ore, 22,400 lbs.; camwood, 560 lbs.; Sanders, 1,200 lbs.; madder, 1,126 lbs.; indigo, 3,600 lbs.; 5,250 lbs.; copperas, 560 lbs.; 12,120 lbs.; iron liquor, 13,500 lbs.; oil of vitriol 1,200 lbs.; blue spirits, 1,250 lbs.; binterate iron, 48,060 lbs.; and bi-chrome, 4,896 lbs. Do not use any dye materials. Use yearly 7,000 gallons of olive oil, of the value of Â£1,760. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is sold either to oil extractors, or used for manure. Use yearly, soap, 10,740 lbs.; and 39,440 lbs., and urine 80,000 gallons. The soaps and seak were formerly sold to grease extractors for 701. per annum, but are now turned into stream. Use steam, at Ravensthorpe 20, and at Batley Carr 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly at Ravensthorpe 1,000 tons, and at Batley Carr 2,000 tons of coal, as the fires from which are given away to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away for manure. Have no suggestions to offer as to the means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by sewage and manufacturing refuse thrown into it. Our stream has always been foul within our knowledge. It is so polluted by works above that it is rendered entirely useless for any purpose other than generating steam. Obtain supply of water for steam boiler purposes from the stream; and consume yearly 200,000 gallons. If the stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of considerable use to us; but we are not able properly to state the exact amount. We manufacture yearly 1,760,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 110,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 200,000 lbs. of dye wares, of all kinds of dyes suitable for woollen goods. The spent dyestuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 60 tons of olive and position oils, of the value of 2,700l. Produce 75 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold and grease extracted. Use yearly, soap 7 tons, alkali 60 tons, and urine 100 tons. The suds are treated for the recovery of the grease, which is done once a year. Use steam, 150 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 4,400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used partly on the railway ballast, and partly ground with the mortar. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away to be used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer as to the best means of avoiding pollution in future, or as to the conservancy of rivers and streams.",

The bed of the stream has silted up to some extent, caused by ashes and solid refuse discharged into it. Our works are affected by floods, partly due to the silting up of the bed of the river, and also to weirs erected across the stream. The condition of the stream has gradually become year by year more dirty; it is polluted to a considerable extent by works above, not, we think, by mines. Obtain supply of water for condensing from the river, from wells, and from bore-holes; for scouring, from waterworks company; and for dyeing, from water collected from a gathering ground. Consume yearly from the waterworks 6,500,000 gallons; but are unable to state the volume from the other sources. If the stream, from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clean and colourless, it would be of annual value to us of Â£150. a year. Manufacture yearly Â£73,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of Â£50,000; and dye Â£370,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of Â£30,000. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soap suds, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 328,183 lbs. of dye wares, in addition to 6,534 gallons of pyroligneous acid. The dye wares used are chiefly logwood, fustic, Sander's wood, madder, limawood, d.o.v., blue spirits, finishing spirits, alum, coppers, myrobalans, bi-chlorate of potash, prussiate of potash, nitrite of iron, and pyrolignite of iron. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly from 10,000 to 11,000 gallons of cloth oil, of the value of Â£1,900. Produce yearly 87,000 lbs. of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil extractors. Use yearly, soap 58,000 lbs., alkali, 560 tons; and urine, 57,600 gallons. The soaps are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain Â£50. a year, but they are sold under their present value. Use steam, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,444 tons of coal; make 100 tons of ashes, which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are carted away by farmers to be used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Our works are not affected by floods. Formerly the condition of the stream was very pure, and abounded with trout; it is now polluted to such a considerable extent as to make it entirely worthless for washing purposes; it is not polluted, within our knowledge, by mines. Obtain supply of water for condensing from the stream, and for dyeing and scouring purposes from wells, from bore-holes, and from waterworks; and consume yearly, 18,000,000 gallons. If the stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value of Â£250 a year. We manufacture yearly 300 tons of goods, of the value of 48,000l. Produce yearly 9,000,000 gallons of liquid refuse from washing and soapsuds, and 9,000,000 gallons from dyeing. The whole of the waste liquid from the dyeing flows direct into the stream, and that from washing and soapsuds goes well to Messrs. The Paige and Company. We extract the grease from the suds, and the effluent water is allowed to flow into the stream. Use yearly 536,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood, potash, myrobalans, pyrolignite, fustics, copperas, Sander's wood, and argols. The spent dye stuffs flow into the stream. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly olive and Price's patent cloth oil, of the value of 2,711. Produce yearly 50 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap, 24 tons; alkali, 29 tons; and urine, 108,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated by Messrs. Paige and Company, by which we gain 654l. a year. Use steam, 109 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 3,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads, mixed with lime, and used for brickmaking. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. If the manufacturers of this town were not allowed to turn the refuse water from dyeing and scouring into the stream, they would be compelled to suspend operations, unless some method was devised to get rid of it by common sewers, or otherwise. The stream is more of a common sewer than a stream, and the water is totally useless for washing or scouring purposes. We think that the most likely plan should avoid pollution in future would be, that all liquid refuse should be pumped into reservoirs on high grounds, for the purpose of irrigation or distribution on farm lands. It would be a very good fertilizer, and the country here is most favourable for such a mode of utilization.",

My works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has been getting gradually worse during the last 20 years. There are two manufacturers situated above mine, where dyeing and milling are carried on, and thus the stream is polluted. Obtain supply of water jointly from wells and the waterworks company; but am not able to give the annual consumption at my works. I only use the water of the Beck for condensing purposes, and as there is not a sufficient supply for scouring, what quantity of it flows down, if rendered clean and colourless, would be a direct money value to me of from 20l. to 30l. a year. Manufacture yearly from 80 to 90 tons of goods, of the value of 14,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works flows direct into the Beck. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 12 tons of olive and rape oil, of the value of 500l. Produce yearly 20 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil and grease extractors; and about 20 tons of dry dust and waste, which are sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 4 tons, alkali 15 tons, and urine 100 tons. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease, but are turned direct into the stream. Use steam, 25 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly from 900 to 1,000 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted away by farmers for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by ashes and other solid refuse thrown into it from dye and other works. Our works are not affected by floods. Formerly the stream was clear and pure, but it is now so much polluted that it is scarcely possible to make it worse; it is polluted by works above, not by mine. Obtain supply of water jointly from wells and from waterworks company, but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, 780,408 lbs. of goods. Produce liquid refuse from dyeing, 200,000 gallons, but are not able to state the volume of liquid refuse produced from other sources. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the sewers. Use yearly, as dye wares, 7,400 lbs. of Sander's wood, 2,240 lbs. of peachwood, and 10,000 lbs. of logwood. The whole of the spent stuffs are sold for manure. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use olive oil and Price's patent cloth oils, of the value of Â£900. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is sold to Messrs. Le Paige and Company, grease extractors. Use yearly, soap, 4,480 lbs.; soda, 36,320 lbs.; and urine, 28,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain, yearly, 40L. Use steam, 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,694 tons of coal; the ashes from which are removed by farmers to be ground with lime to make mortar. We have no suggestions to offer.",

Manufacture yearly 100 tons of goods, of the value of Â£25,000. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works flows direct into the sewers and thence into the stream. Use yearly 2 tons of dye wares, chiefly from the stuff burnt. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 30 tons of olive oil, of the value of Â£2,000. Produce yearly half a ton of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil and soap extractors. Use yearly, soap, 6 tons; alkali, 20 tons; and urine, 100 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 40L a year. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,000 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are removed by farmers for manure.

Tan yearly 100 tons of English hides, and produce 48 tons of leather. Use yearly, time 25 tons, bark 300 tons, valonia 25 tons, gambir 10 tons, and size ponds' dung 4 tons. Obtain yearly 6 tons of hair in the process of depilation, which is sold to plasterers. The fleshings are sold to glue and size boilers. I have 100 tan pits, varying in sizes from 6 feet by 4 feet by 6 in. by 3 feet 6 in. by 5 feet. Do not use any dye wares. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my tanyard flows into sewers, and thence into the Beck. Use steam, 4 nominal horse-power.

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by refuse thrown in from mills and dye houses. Our mills are affected to some extent by floods, caused chiefly by the silting up of the bed of the stream. 20 years ago the water of the stream was comparatively pure, was used largely for domestic purposes, and abounded with fish; now it is very foul, and there is no fish in it. I supply of water jointly from the river and from waterworks, and consume yearly 40,000,000 gallons. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of 500l. We manufacture yearly 2,000,000 lbs. of goods, and dye 500,000 lbs., of the value of 200,000l. Produce yearly 40,000,000 gallons of liquid refuse, of which the exception of about 6,000,000 gallons, which are forced across the river to some, seak works, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly as bleaching wares, 33,600 lbs. of dye woods; 3,000 lbs. of cochineal, 3,000 lbs. The spent dye woods are burnt. Use yearly as bleaching materials, rough and rolled brimstone, 67,200 lbs. Use yearly 200 tons of olive, rape, and patent oils, of the value of 9,000l. Produce 100 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to extractors. Use yearly, 200 tons; alkali, 16 tons; and urine, 50,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain yearly 130l. Use steam and water as power, steam 45, and water 100 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal; make 300 tons of ashes, which are used partly to repair roads, and partly ground up with lime for mortar. The excrements of our workpeople are partly utilized by earth closets for manure, and the remainder flows into the river. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, for the conservancy of rivers and streams, that a central representative authority for each river basin should be appointed, with very adequate powers.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused partly by a weir formed across the stream three-quarters of a mile below our works, in which account the stream is very sluggish, and the solid matters in suspension are deposited. Our works are not affected by floods; but floods are caused, not so much by the silting up of the bed of the stream as by the obstruction of the Beck; the waterway is very contracted and not of sufficient capacity to take away the water in time of flood. In our recollection was well stocked with fish, but now, since the great development of the woollen trade in this district, it is polluted to such a degree as to render it unfit for manufacturing purposes; it is also polluted also by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells, springs, and from a gathering ground collected in a reservoir, and consume yearly 5,200,000 gallons. We manufacture yearly about 233,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 14,700l. Produce 3,450,000 gallons of liquid refuse from washing, and 1,500,000 gallons from dyeing. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except sops, goes direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. We use yearly as dye wares 102,800 lbs. of dye woods. The spent dye stuffs are burnt. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 18 tons of urine, of the value of about 1,000l. Produce yearly from 12 to 15 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold for manure. Do not use any soap, but use yearly, alkali 7 tons, and urine 12,000 gallons. The falling refuse is treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain Â£1 a year. Use steam, 25 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,300 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads and for brick making. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Obtain supply of water jointly from the river, and from the Dewsbury and Batley Waterworks Company. As we are manufacturing a fine class of goods, the condition of the river does not make much difference to us; but if it becomes much worse we shall have to purchase all water, even for washing purposes, from the Waterworks Company. Manufacture yearly 2,340 packs of goods. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except the soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly Gallipoli and cloth oils, of the value of 684l. Produce yearly 29 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, the oil from which is extracted, and the refuse is afterwards used for manure. Use yearly alkali 20 tons, and urine 45 tons.

The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. The chief polluters of the Calder are the dyers; and if they were compelled to filter the refuse before turning it into rivers and streams, they would be comparatively clear.

Obtain supply of water occasionally from the river, but chiefly from wells and boreholes; also from surface drainage and from an adjacent colliery; and consume yearly 10,000,000 gallons. If the stream, from which we might derive our supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to us of 50l. a year. Manufacture yearly 480,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 24,000l.; and also operate upon 480,000 lbs. of goods. Produce yearly 5,000,000 gallons of liquid refuse from washing, and 2,000,000 from soapsuds. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream. We have only just commenced dyeing, and therefore are unable to state the quantity of dye wasted yearly. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 25 tons of Gallipoli, rape, and Price's oil, of the value of 1,000l. Produce yearly 30 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is partly sold to oil and grease extractors, and partly used for manure. Use yearly soap 10 tons, soda ash 15 tons, and urine 12,000 gallons. We have only just commenced to treat the soapsuds for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,600 tons of coal, which are partly used as ballast for the railway, and partly thrown into the stream. The excrements of our workplace people are used for manure.",

Obtain supply of water from the river, but do not know the annual consumption at our works. If the river was rendered clean and colourless, it would be of considerable value to us, but are not able to fix the amount. We full and scribble yearly 43,680 lbs. of goods. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use yearly 15,000 lbs. of dye wares; chiefly logwood and fustic. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly Gallipoli oil, but as this is found by persons who send us the goods to operate upon, we are unable to give the quantity consumed. The whole of the waste liquid produced in caring is sold, and removed from the premises every week. Use yearly, soap 12 tons, alkali 2 tons, and urine 50 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam and water as power; steam 30, and water 30, nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 1,100 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for agricultural purposes. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The effluent water eventually flows into the river Calder. Use yearly 38,500 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood, Sander's wood, camwood, fustic, indigo, and other liquid dyes. The spent dyestuffs are partly used for repairing walks and footpaths, and do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 1 ton of oil of the value of 710l. Produce yearly 6,200 lbs. of waste oil in the process of carding, which is partly re-manufactured; the other part is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly soap, 44,800 lbs., and 49,200 lbs. do not use any urine. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam 20 nominal horse power. Consume yearly 1,500 tons of coal, the coarse ashes from which are used for repairing roads; the finer ashes are mixed with the excrements of our workpeople and used for manure.

It is polluted to a very fearful extent by works above, not by mines situate near my works. Obtain supply of water from the river, but it is so exceedingly foul that I contemplate sinking wells to obtain a purer supply of water. If the river were clean, it would save me the expense of sinking wells, and bore-holes. Manufacture yearly 120 tons of goods of the value of 30,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Do not use any dye waters or bleaching materials. Use yearly olive 40 tons, of the value of 2,040l. Produce yearly 17 tons of waste wood which is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap 5 tons, and lye 800,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal, the whole of the ashes from which are deposited on land adjoining the mill in order to raise it out of the reach of floods.

The bed of the river has not silted up to any great extent, and the condition of it has not changed within our knowledge during the last 20 years. It is polluted by works above, not very much, but it is considerably polluted by works below to a very great extent, because the owners of mills are not prevented from doing it, although they threaten us with proceedings if we pollute the stream; it is not polluted by us. Obtain supply of water from a reservoir at the head of the stream which is formed for manufacturing purposes, and the whole of the millers on the stream pay rates for supporting and maintaining this supply. Some of the millowners allege that they have a prescriptive right (20 years) to foul the water of the stream. The river at its source, from which we obtain our supply, is clean enough for any other purpose except drinking; but when it flows down the river course for two miles it is so extensively polluted that it is as black as ink, so that the drinking of it clean opposite our works would be of no direct monetary value to us. Manufacturer yearly 1,200 packs of goods, of the value of 18,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dyes or bleaches. Use yearly 3000 gallons of olive and patent oil, of the value of 600l. Produce yearly 1,600 tons of waste wool in carding, which is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap 100 lbs., alkali 10 tons, and the urine of our workpeople. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam and water as power; steam 20, and water 15 nominal horse. Consume yearly 600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads and footpaths. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We are of opinion that 90 per cent. of the liquid refuse from manufactories and mills could be kept out of rivers and streams which is now sent into them if depositing tanks and filters were adopted. Four years ago we built a dyeworks connected with our works, but have been prevented from using it because a dyer whose works are situated 300 yards below us near the junction of Blakebourne with the Calder, and whose works have only been in operation for seven or eight years, threatens us with proceedings if we turn our liquid refuse into the stream, although he with impunity himself turns all the liquid refuse from his dye vats into the stream, and we are therefore obliged to send to him the whole of our goods to dye. If our dyeworks were in operation we should be able to comply with the standards of purity recommended in the report of the Rivers Pollution Commission on the Mersey and Ribble Basins, and we are of opinion that everybody could bring all their liquid refuse to the standard of purity before turning it into rivers and streams.",

The bed of the river has silted up, caused by refuse from foundations of buildings, ashes, cinders, scoria from mills and foundries, and other solid refuse thrown in. My works are affected by floods to a considerable extent, and I suffer great loss therefrom. The condition of the river is very foul indeed, it is seriously polluted by refuse from dye houses, mills, and factories; but not much by mines. In the summer time especially the drift from it is very bad, more so when choked up by the water-wheels. Formerly it was a pure stream and contained fish. Obtain supply of water jointly from the Halifax Waterworks Company and from the river, and consume 2,500,000 gallons yearly. I have lost immensely by the bed of the stream, and in fact have lost my trade to the extent of many thousands a year. I am now trying to regain it by using water supplied by the Corporation Waterworks, but cannot succeed as I am not confident of having such pure water as my opponents have  at the upper parts of the stream. I full yearly 520,000 lbs. of goods. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my works, except soapsuds, flows into the river. Use yearly, alkali 12 tons. Use either water as power; 40 nominal horse-power, and steam 16 nominal horse-power, but only very seldom. Consume yearly 70 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads; but none are thrown into the river. The excrements of my workplace are used for manure. I suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future that sewage and liquid refuse from manufactories, mills, and shops should be applied to irrigate land, and not turned into rivers and streams.",

Obtain supply of water partly from the streams and partly from the Halifax Corporation Waterworks. Manufacture yearly 50 tons of goods, of the value of 1,700l. The whole of the waste liquid produced flows direct into the streams. Use yearly 58,240 lbs. of dye woods, principally log and other woods. The spent dye is thrown into the river without any bleaching materials. Use yearly 12 tons of Gallipoli oil, about 19,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated to recover the grease, by which we gain 25l. a year. Use steam, 2 nominal horse-power.

Use yearly as bleaching materials 300 lbs. of Newcastle soda. Use yearly 7 tons of Gallipoli and cloth oils, of the value of 350. Use water as power, 15 nominal horse.

Use yearly 16 tons of dye wares, principally logwood, fustic, alum, and copper. The spent dyestuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 1,800 gallons of Gallipoli oil. The whole of the waste wool produced is used over again, and the refuse only used for manure. Do not use either soap, alkali, or urine. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 40 tons of coal, the ashes from which are turned into the streams. The excrements of my workpeople are used for manure. I would suggest, that as far as practicable, solid and liquid refuse should be prevented from being turned into rivers and streams.",

Obtain supply of water from the stream, and consume yearly 10,088,000 gallons. As we have had to incur an expense of 300l. in constructing works to clean water to our mills for manufacturing purposes, the cleansing of the river would not be of any direct money value to us. Manufacture yearly 2,000 packs of wool, of the value of 30,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soapuds, flows direct into the river. Use yearly 40,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly dyewoods. The spent dye stuffs are turned into the stream. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 30 tons of olive oil, of the value of 1,500l. A portion of the waste wool produced in carding is worked over again; the remainder is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap 12 tons; alkali 4 tons; urine, 12 tons; and ammonia, 6 tons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 601. a year. Use steam, 40 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,700 tons of coal, the ashes from which are partly used in repairing roads, partly ground and mixed with lime for mortar, and partly turned into the river. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The whole of the waste wool produced at my works in carding is either sold or used for manure. Use yearly, soap 8 tons, and an unknown quantity of urine, all we can get. The soap suds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which I gain about one-third of the cost of the oil and soap.

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by solid refuse thrown into it. The mills are not affected by floods. The condition of the river within our knowledge has very considerably deteriorated. It was formerly clear, and abounded with fish; it is now as black as ink, and fish are unable to live in it. It is polluted by works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water from canal, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly 312,000 lbs. of goods of the value of 16,881l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into sewers, and thence into the stream. Do not use any dye works or bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,200l. The whole of the waste wool produced in the process of carding is sold to waste dealers. Do not use any soap, alkali, or urine. As we rent room and power, are not able to state the nominal horse-power employed, the quantity of coals consumed, or what is done with the ashes. The excrements of our workpeople are removed by a contractor under the Corporation. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that ashes and other solid refuse from mills, factories, and works should be prohibited from being turned into rivers and streams.",

The bed of the river has silted up above and below us, but not opposite our works. Our works are not affected by floods. The river within our knowledge has always been a dirty stream, but it has gradually become worse year by year. It is polluted to a very great extent by works above, and by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river for condensing purposes; and from wells and boreholes and a pure stream which flows through our premises for manufacturing purposes; and consume yearly about 150,000,000 gallons. We manufacture and dye yearly 597,229 lbs. of wool, and produce 341,000 lbs. of cloth, of the value of 120,000l. Produce 78,000 gallons of liquid refuse from washing, 4,000,000 from dyeing, and 67,000,000 from soap suds. The whole of the liquid produced at our works, except soap suds, flows direct into the river. Use as regards dyeing and dye woods, and are not able to give the quantity used yearly. Use yearly 60 tons of olive oil, of the value of 3,300l. Produce yearly 18 tons of waste, which is used for manufacturing low-priced oils, urine, and soap. The excrements are treated for the recovery of the oil, and we gain yearly 100l. Use steam water and water as power; use 10, and water 150 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 5,000 tons of coal; make about 700 tons of ashes, which are used for various purposes, and none have been put into the river since 1866. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that it should be declared illegal to turn any solid or liquid refuse into rivers and streams.",

The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Use yearly, 18,000 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly logwood, Sander's wood, shumac, and bi-chrome. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, 12 tons of Gaillopil and olive oil, of the value of 600l. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is used over again. Use yearly, soap, 7 tons, alkali 2 tons, and urine 21,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain 181l. a year. Use steam, 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly, 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for the repair of roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all solid waste should be kept out of rivers and streams.

The condition of the river is very bad, and getting worse year by year. It is polluted to a very serious extent by works above, and by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river Colne, the canal, and bore holes; but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. If the river or stream from which we might derive a supply of water were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a very great advantage to us, but we are unable to fix the money value. We manufacture yearly 400,000 lbs. of dye wares, principally logwood, camwood, and fustic. The spent dye stuffs are burned under the boiler furnaces. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 20 tons of olive oil, of the value of Â£1,200. A portion of the waste wool produced in carding is re-used by us; the refuse portion (about 20 tons annually) is sold to artificial manure manufacturers. Use yearly, soap, 9 tons; alkali, 10 tons; and lime, 38,000 gallons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain about 40ÅÂ© a year. Use both steam and water as power, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,600 tons of coal; the ashes from which are carted on to waste ground, and occasionally used to repair roads. Part of the excrements of our workpeople is used for manure, and the remainder turned into the river. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers, as they should be compelled to purify all water polluted by them, as far as it is practicable to do so, before turning it into rivers and streams.",

Use yearly 12 tons of Gallipoli oil of the value of 700. Produce yearly 13 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil and grease extractors. Use yearly, soap, 7 tons; alkali, 1 ton; and urine, 20,800 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease by which we gain 26l. a year. Use steam 40 and water 60 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,040 tons of coal; make about 160 tons of ashes, half of which is turned into the river, and half used for repairing roads.

Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has been much the same as it is now during the last 20 years. It is very seriously polluted by refuse from dye works and mills, and by town sewage; not by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. If the river from which we might derive a supply of water were rendered clear and colourless it would be of direct money value to us of goods of the value of 20,000, and dye 125,000 lbs. of the value of 6,501. The whole of the waste liquid, except soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Use yearly 48,200 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly dye woods into the river. The spent dye stuffs are burned. Use yearly 2,000 gallons of olive oil, of the value of 450. The waste wool produced in carding is partly sold to oil and grease extractors, and partly used for manure. Use yearly, soap, 3 tons; alkali, 1 ton; and urine 30,000 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain yearly. Use water and steam as power, steam 25, and water 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,000 tons of coal; the ashes from which are used partly for repairing roads, and partly filled into old stone quarries. The excrements of our workpeople are mixed with refuse shoddy and carted away for manure.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by solid and other refuse thrown into it. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream varies much; sometimes it is much more foul than at others; it is considerably polluted by works above, and by mines. Obtain supply of water from the stream, from springs, and from wells, but do not know the annual consumption at our works. As we derive the chief supply of water from wells on our own premises, the condition of the stream does not very much affect us. Manufacture yearly, 83 tons of goods, of the value of 30,000l. We have depositing tanks, and used to filter the liquid refuse produced from our works, but it did not answer, and we now pump it on to land. After flowing over or percolating into the land, the effluent water finds its way into the Shepley Beck. We use yearly, as dye wares, logwood, 78,400 lbs.; camwood, 2,240 lbs.; Sanders' wood, 336 lbs.; fustic, 2,240 lbs.; alum, 1,120 lbs.; and madder, 2,240 lbs. The spent dyestuffs are all burned. Do not use any bleaching materials. We use yearly, 20 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 1,500l. Part of the waste wool produced in carding is used again, and the part that we cannot use is sold for manure. Use yearly, soap, 6 tons, alkali, 3 tons, and urine, 30 gallons. The soap suds flow down to land and irrigate it. Use steam, 50 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 2,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workpeople are used for manure. No suggestions to offer.",

Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 2,330 gallons of olive oil of the value of 500l. Produce yearly 15,000 lbs. of waste wool in the process of carding, which are made into shoddy.

Consume yearly 850 tons of coal, and make 100 tons of ashes, which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of our workplace are mixed with earth and used for manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that ashes and other solid refuse should be kept out of rivers, and that all fluid and liquid refuse should flow into filtering tanks and be filtered through ashes, sand, and sawdust, and the solid refuse thus deposited to be carted away for manure.",

The worst of the waste wool produced in carding is sold for manure. Use yearly, say 25 tons of alkali, six tons; no mire. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of grease, by which we gain about Â£2. Use steam 30 nominal horse-power.

The whole of this liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream, and hence into the stream. Do not use any dye wares. Use yearly, as bleaching materials, chloride of lime, 15,000 lbs. Use yearly, Gallipoli oil, 400 gallons, of the value of 1154. Use yearly: soap, 10 tons; alkali, 36 tons; no urine. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,600 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted on to the railway ballast. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that manufacturers and others should be compelled to have disposing tanks and filters, and that the whole of the liquid refuse produced should be filtered before being allowed to be turned into rivers and streams.",

If the stream were rendered clear and colourless, it would be considerable money value to us, but we are not able to fix the amount.

The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows into the river, and thence into the river. Use yearly as dye wares, chicory and wood also indigo and aniline dyes. The spent dyestuffs are burned. Use yearly 10,000 gallons of olive oil, of the value of 2,264. The waste produced in the process of carding is partly re-used, and partly applied as manure. Use yearly soap, 188,000 lbs., soda-ash, 90,000 lbs., 16,000 lbs., and no urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain yearly 100l. Consume yearly 5,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are removed from the premises, and used for repairing roads and paving. The excrements of our workplace are partly treated by the Gux system and used as manure, and partly conveyed by waterclosets into sewers, and thence into the stream.

It is polluted to a very great extent by works above and by town's sewage, but not to our knowledge by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river; and consume yearly for all purposes 2,000,000 gallons. The river from which we derive our supply of water rendered clear and colourless, it would undoubtedly be of great advantage to us, but we are not able to fix a money value to it. Manufacture yearly 1,568,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 140,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 900,000 gallons, and from dyeing 1,000,000 gallons. The whole of this flows unfiltered into the sewers. Use yearly 130,000 lbs. of dye wares; chiefly logwood, camwood, and Sander's wood. The spent dye stuffs are burned. We also use 2,500 lbs. of indigo, and 900 lbs. of cochineal. The spent liquor from these goes into stream, 0. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 30 tons of Gallipoli oil, the value of 1,600l. Produce yearly 10,000 lbs. of wool in the process of carding, which is sold to waste dealers. Use yearly soap 60 tons, and alkali from 10 to 15 tons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 20l. yearly. Use steam, 100 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly from 2,500 to 3,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away to refuse. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by sewers into the river.

The spent dye stuffs are taken away and used for manure. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 35 tons of rape and olive oil. The whole of the waste wood produced at our works is used for manure. Use yearly soap 60 tons; Soap 12 tons, and alkali 18 tons; but the principal portion of our goods is cleansed with fullers earth, of which we use 20 tons yearly. Use steam, 36 nominal horse-power.

My works are not affected by floods. There has been very little alteration, within my knowledge, in the condition of the stream. The stream is seriously polluted, and when it reaches our works it is unfit for manufacturing purposes, and I use it for irrigation; it is not polluted by mines. Obtain supply of water from wells and bore-holes; but do not know the annual consumption at my works. Manufacture yearly 72,000 lbs., dye 30,000 lbs., and bleach 10,000 lbs. The whole of the waste liquid produced at my works, except soapsuds, flows into sewers and is used for irrigation. Use yearly 2 tons of logwood 2 tons, and also aniline dyes. The solid spent dye stuffs are carted away. Use yearly as bleaching materials 300 lbs. of chloride of lime. Do not use any oil. Use yearly soap 5 tons, and ammonia 20,000 lbs. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use steam, 6 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly coals of the value of 50l., the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of my workpeople are removed in carts and used for manure. I suggest that the liquid refuse from manufactories be used for irrigation.",

Obtain supply of water from the river, but am not able to give the annual consumption.

The whole of the liquid refuse produced at my works flows into a settling pond and thence into the river. Manufacture yearly, brown paper 250 tons, and sugar paper 350 tons.

Consume yearly 2,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing roads. The excrements of my workpeople are used for manure. I suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in the future, that a series of intercepting sewers should be formed, commencing from the first point of pollution, to take in all polluting liquids from works, collieries, and town sewers, the whole to be conveyed to convenient points for utilization. A universal rate should be levied on the property within the river basin for the erection and maintenance of those works.",

The bed of the stream has silted up to some extent owing to the flood water running down, and shale thrown in from quarries. Our works are affected by floods, but the stream has been fouled by the refuse of other works for more than 50 years. Obtain our supply of water jointly from the river, from a stream, and from springs, but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works. If the river or stream were rendered clear and colourless it would be a great advantage to us, but we cannot state the direct money value. Manufacture yearly 20 tons of goods, of the value of 8,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the river. We use yearly 1,000 lbs. of dyewares, chiefly logwood, camwood, madder, alum and bi-chrome. The spent dyestuffs are turned into the river. Do not use bleaching materials. Use yearly 25 gallons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 15l. The whole of the waste wool produced in carding is partly worked up again, and the remainder sold. Use yearly 20 tons of soap, and no urine. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of grease. Use both steam and water as power, steam 12 and water 6 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 450 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for the repair of roads. The excrements of our workpeople are carted on to land to be used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the river has silted up, but not very considerably; this is caused chiefly by the dâÃ Ã¶Â©bris and other solid substances brought down in a great flood, caused by the bursting of the Dale Dyke reservoir. The river is polluted by works above; but when the good volume of water is flowing down the river, it is not much inconvenience to us; in dry weather it is a nuisance. The river is not polluted by mines within our knowledge. Obtain supply of water from our tanyards. We tan yearly, 300 tons of heavy salted hides; and produce 185 tons of leather. Use yearly, 200 tons, callet, 200, valonia, 200, and gambir, or terra japonica, 70. Obtain yearly 30 tons of hair in the process of tanning, which are sold by these manufacturers. Do not obtain any fatty matter in the process of fleshing.

Use yearly 17,663 lbs. of dye wares, chiefly lye wood, canwood, barwood, fustic, bichrome, tartar, cochineal, copperas, and alum. The spent dye stuffs are used for manure. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 9 tons of Gallipoli oil, of the value of 430l. The whole of the waste produced in carding is sold. Use yearly, soap 2 tons, alkali 3 tons. Do not know the quantity of urine. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 144. a year. Use steam and water as power; steam 17 and water 4 nominal horse-power.

Obtain supply of water jointly from wells and from stream, but am not able to give the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly goods of the value of 3,000l. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct to the stream. Do not use either dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 500 gallons of olive oil of the value of 112l. Produce yearly about 2 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to oil extractors. Do not use either soap, alkali, or urine. The soap and water are used for the recovery of the grease. Use both steam and water as power, steam 8 and water 3 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople are mixed with soil and used for manure. The occupier of the mill below ours will not allow us to turn the liquid refuse produced at the stream and thereby pollute it; he and the occupiers of the mills which have been established for some years in this district turn the whole of the liquid refuse produced at their works into the streams, but will not permit the occupiers of mills of recent erection, although upon the same stream, to exercise the same privilege; this seriously affects the interest of the occupiers of the last-named mills.",

The bed of the stream has silted up owing to the solid refuse thrown into it and brought down in time of flood. The country has been denuded of wood within the last 70 or 80 years, and mosses a good deal drained; consequently the heavy rains have nothing to retain them, and they flow off in considerable floods, carrying sand and debris, and silt up the bed of the streams. Our tanyards are affected by floods. There has been no change in the condition of the river within our knowledge, during the last seven years. The stream is not polluted by works above, but the Tame is seriously polluted. One of our firm, much to his surprise, caught in the Tame, at Upper Mill, one mile above this place, six small fish in good condition, showing that fish can still exist in the stream although it is badly polluted. The stream is not polluted by mines within our knowledge. Obtain supply of water from springs, but cannot give the annual consumption at our tanyards. Tan yearly 20,000 hides, weighing from 40 to 96 lbs. each. Produce 800,000 lbs. of leather. Use yearly, lime, bark, valonia, shuma, gambir, and gall nuts, about 321 tons; also pigeons' dung, but not a very large quantity. Obtain yearly 725 tons of hair in the process of depilation, which is sold to plasterers. Obtain 60 tons of fatty matter in the process of fleshing, which is partly boiled into size, and partly sold to size boilers. We have 100 tanpits, 7 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet. Do not use any dyeing materials. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our tan-yards flows into depositing tanks, and thence into the stream. Use steam 12 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 350 tons of coal, the ashes from which are ground and mixed with lime to be used for building purposes. The excrements of our workplace are removed on to land, and used as manure. We are of opinion that if all manufacturers were compelled to neutralise acid or alkali flowing into rivers, it would improve matters very much. Thoroughly cleansing the filter ponds through which the polluted water could pass would try to the river would deprive it of its deleterious substances, and would probably not be very costly. If great care is not taken, nothing is more deadly than refuse from a paper mill; yet in mines, close under power mill stream, very fine trout can be seen in great numbers, showing that such manufactures can exist and do exist, without polluting the stream. The same means in other districts should produce similar results.",

Do not know the weight of the dye wares used yearly. The liquid dye stuffs are turned into the river, and the solid are burned. Use yearly as bleaching materials 340 lbs. of solid brimstone. Do not use any oil. Use yearly 3 tons of soap, 3 tons of soda, and 1 ton of ammonia. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of grease, but are turned into the river. Use steam, 14 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly from 1,400 to 1,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away on to waste land.

The bed of the stream has not silted up near our works; it is our custom to clean out that portion of it yearly. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has not changed with our remembrance. The stream is discoloured by refuse from dye works and by all the woollen cloth mills to some but not to a serious extent. There are no mines in this district. We use the water of the river for all purposes at our works, but are not able to state the quantity. We take what is required from the stream, and return the water after use. Except after heavy rains, or when the mud in the bed of the river is artificially disturbed, the stream is sufficiently clear and colourless for all our manufacturing purposes. We manufacture yearly 2,550 cwt. of goods, of the value of 120,000. Produce yearly, liquid refuse from washing, 800,000 gallons. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works, except soapuds, flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye wares at these mills. The dyeing is done at public dye works. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly, olive oil of the value of 1,200. Produce yearly from 4 to 5 tons of waste wood in the process of carding, which resembles a dealers in \"focks\" and \"do.\" Use yearly, soap 20 tons, soda 15 tons, and urine 6,000 gallons. The soapuds are partially treated for the recovery of the grease, and we gain 60l. a year. Use both steam and water as power. Consume yearly 2,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are employed as road material. A small portion of the excrements of our workpeople is returned to the land as manure. There is considerable accumulation of mud and manure on the stream, which is moved by hand labour every summer, the mills being stopped up to three days simultaneously for this purpose. The water is kept on the scour, and the mud being loosened by spade labour.",

The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soapsuds, flows direct into the river. Do not use any of the wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly, olive oil of the value of 800l. Produce yearly 3 tons of waste wood in the process of carding, a portion of which is re-manufactured, and the remainder sold to flock and shoddy dealers. Use yearly, soap 15 tons, soda 10 tons, and alkali 20,000 gallons. The larger portion of the soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 40l. a year. Use both steam and water as power; steam 100 and water 120 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 1,400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used for repairing and mending, and mixed with lime for mortar. The excrements of our workplace are passed by sewers into the river.

The bed of the river has not silted up, as it is cleared out periodically; otherwise it would silt up to a considerable extent and become a nuisance. The custom is to send the mud down the stream till it reaches the Severn. This plan ought to be abandoned, and the mud should be wheeled out of the bed of the stream and utilized. Our works are not affected by floods. Twenty years ago the stream here was comparatively pure and the water beautifully clear and admirably suited for business purposes; it is now polluted by the refuse from all the shoddy works above, which at times interferes with our wool washing process, and if continued will lead to a lawsuit or compel us to adopt some other mode, more expensive, of washing. The river is polluted by works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river and from springs, and consume yearly in washing and for cleansing purposes, 6,000,000 gallons. Clean water is a necessity in our business, and we must, if possible, prevent its further pollution. We are anxious to see some general rules for avoiding pollution imperative on all manufacturers. We manufacture yearly 25 tons of goods of the value of 12,000l. Produce yearly liquid refuse from washing 4,000,000 gallons. We have no depositing tanks, and the whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly Gallipoli oil of the value of 300l. All the waste wood from the various processes is sold, and is an annual gain to us. We use yearly soap, alkali, and the value of 300l. a year. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use both steam and water as power. Consume yearly 700 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workplace are collected and utilized as manure. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that all manufacturers be compelled to return the water used in the various processes to the stream practically free from impurities and colouring matter, and that town sewage should be prevented from being turned into rivers. This would, in the case of the manufacturers in the Frome valley, involve but little trouble or difficulty.",

The bed of the stream has silted up, but not to any appreciable extent. Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the stream has not materially changed within our knowledge. It is polluted occasionally by dye and other works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water from the stream, but cannot possibly supply the annual consumption at our works. The river is clear enough for our purposes throughout the greater part of the year. Manufacture yearly 250,000 lbs. of goods, of the value of 50,000. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works, except soaps, flows direct into the stream. Use yearly as dye wares, logwood and bar wood 81 tons, dry salts, such as copers, 10 tons, 1 ton of vitriol 3 tons, and alum 4 tons. The solid refuse is used on land, and the liquid is turned into the stream. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 13 tons of olive oil. Produce yearly about 1 tons of waste wool in the process of carding, which is sold to waste dealers. Yearly, soap 14 tons, alkali 15 tons, and uniting 19,500 gallons. The soapsuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain 25l. Use both steam and water as power; steam 100 and water nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 2,500 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of our workpeople pass into sewers and thence into the stream. We have no suggestions to offer.",

We attribute this to two causes; first, the extraction of the grease from soapsuds of woollen works by the Inkbrook Grease Extracting Company; and, secondly, to the slackness of the shoddy and flock trade in this neighbourhood during the last two or three years. The river is polluted by works above, but not to any appreciable extent; not by mines. Obtain supply of water from the stream, but do not know the annual consumption at our works. We dye yearly about 250 tons of wool. The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows direct into the stream. Use yearly 10 tons of dye wares, chiefly log and other woods. Do not use any bleaching materials or oil. Use yearly, soda 5 tons, and urine 5,200 gallons; the whole of this goes into the stream. Use steam, 12 nominal horse-power.

The bed of the stream has not silted up, but the mud and sand are yearly removed by disturbance called \"mudding.\" Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the river is not clear as formerly (35 years ago), and a more abundant growth of weeds exists, especially the so-called \"American weed.\" The river is polluted by works above not by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the stream and wells, but are not able to give the annual consumption at our works; we use millions of gallons daily. Manufacture yearly 75 tons of goods, of the value of 60,000l. The whole of the waste liquid is discharged direct into the river. There are depositing tanks for the soapsuds, oil, and refuse from the scouring of the cloth after weaving and after milling; about 14,000 gallons of this refuse are treated weekly by a company, by a patent process, for the recovery of the grease. The liquid refuse is then turned into the stream; the greasy matter is carted away from the premises for subsequent treatment. Do not use any dyes or bleaching materials. Use yearly olive oil, Galipoli, Malaga, and Sicily, of the value of 1,000l. The waste wool produced in the process of carding is used again in manufacture. Use yearly 202 tons of alkali 9 tons, and urine 30,000 gallons. The excreta are stored for the recovery of the grease, but we gain nothing by the extraction. Use both steam and water as power, steam 72 and water 24 nominal horse-power.

Use yearly soap, 3 tons; fullers earth, 6 tons; soda, 1 ton; and urine, 7,000 gallons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use steam and water as power, steam 30 and water 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are used to repair roads. The excrements of my workpeople are turned into the stream. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Use yearly, soap 6 tons, soda 2 tons, and urine 20,000 gallons. The soapuds are treated for the recovery of the grease, by which we gain Â£251 a year.

Our mills are affected by floods, but this is not owing to the silting up of the bed of the stream. There has been no material difference in the condition of the river with our knowledge. The stream is not polluted by works nor by mines. Obtain supply of water from the river, which is sufficiently clear for our purpose, but are not able to state the annual consumption at our works. Manufacture yearly, 290,000 lbs. of goods of the value of Â£28,000. Produce liquid refuse from dyeing, 45,000 gallons, and from soapuds and washing, 45,000 gallons. The liquid refuse flows unfiltered direct into the river. Use yearly, 12 tons of dye wares; chiefly logwood, cochineal, madder, tartar, and indigo. The spent dye stuffs are either burned or used for manure. Use as bleaching materials, 4 tons of olive oil. Use 20 tons of waste oil of the value of Â£1,000. Produce yearly, 40,000 lbs. of waste wool in the process of carding, which are either re-used or sold for manure. Use yearly, soap 10,000 lbs.; alkali, 7,000 lbs.; and urine 20,000 gallons. The soapuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease. Use both steam and water as power; steam 10, and water 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 100 tons of coals, lhe ashes from which are used on our own land. The excrements of our workpeople arc used for manure. We have no suggestions to oiler as to the pollution of rivers and streams.",

Our works are not affected by floods. Obtain supply of water from the river, and consume yearly about 400,000 gallons. We have one coke tower for condensing sulphuric acid. Use yearly, pyrites 60 tons, and sulphuric acid 1,050 lbs., and the yearly, aluminum oxide about 1,000 tons. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the sewers, and thence into the stream. Use steam, 8 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are carted away. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by waterclosets into sewers, and thence into the river.

The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by the muddy tidal water of the Severn flowing over the dam at spring tides, and depositing silt. Our works are not affected by floods. The stream is very turbid, but the condition of it varies. The river is polluted by works above; not, to our knowledge, by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from river, wells, and water-works; consume about 54,000,000 gallons yearly. If the water is rendered clear and colorless, the direct money value to us would be inappreciable. We have three condensing towers, 80 feet high 5 feet square; two, 32 feet by 8 feet square. There are also two flush towers. Our works are 38 feet 6 inches high, and 5 feet 4 inches wide. The contents of the seven towers are 12,175 cubic feet. We use, and produce yearly, common salt 7,000 tons, sulphur 200 tons, pyrites 6,250 tons, limestone 7,200 tons, lime 2,000 tons, oxide of manganese 1,150 tons, bleaching powder 1,500 tons, alkali 4,200 tons, ammoniacal liquor 1,468,000 gallons, phosphate of lime and bones 73 tons, nitrate of soda 240 tons. We condense for use yearly 2,000,000 gallons of acid, 26âÃ Ã»-27âÃ Ã» Twad., and 740,000 gallons 22âÃ Ã»-24âÃ Ã» Twad. We condense and run to waste yearly 2,205,000 gallons of acid 20âÃ Ã» Twad. We produce yearly 5,950,000 gallons of liquid refuse, which flow into depositing tanks, and thence into the river. The whole of the alkali waste at our works is operated upon, and 400 tons of sulphur are recovered annually, at a cost of about 51s. 2d. per ton. The sulphur recovered is about equal to the best seconds Silesian value from 5l. to 7l. a ton. We do not recover the manganese from the waste chloride of manganese, but we are erecting Deacon's chlorine apparatus, which will avoid the production of waste manganese. Use steam, 105 (Boulton & Watt standard) nominal horse-power. Use yearly 21,500 tons of coal. Make 3,200 tons of ashes, which are thrown on to our waste heap. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed from dry earth closets, and used for manure. Have no suggestions to offer.",

The bed of that portion of the stream opposite our works is prevented from silting up by constant dredging. Our works are not affected by floods. The river Avon is polluted by works above and by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river and from the waterworks company; the consumption at our works is very large, but we are unable to give the volume. The river water is polluted, but not to such extent as to render it unfit for our soda, or for steam-boiler purposes. We do not decompose the salt. Use yearly, sulphate of soda, 2,010 tons; tallow, 2,900 tons; palm and other greases oils, 1,250 tons; resin, 900 tons; carbonate of soda crystals, 40 tons; common salt, not converted into alkali, 560 tons; quicklime, 500 tons; sulphuric acid, 25 tons; hydrochloric acid, 50 tons; bichromate of potash, 3 tons; ultramarine, 5 tons. Produce yearly, 7,500 lbs. candles; 20,160 dozen lbs. dips,and 31,200 dozen lbs. of composites; and distillation of fats and oils: palm and other oils, 520 tons; silicate of soda, 1,000 tons; pit, 80 tons; and crystallised sulphate of soda, 200 tons. Produce yearly, 4,000,000 gallons of liquid refuse; we have no depositing tanks; and this flows directly into the stream. We are erecting plant for recovering the sulphur from the alkali waste, according to Mondâs patent process. Use steam, 45 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly, 9,000 tons of coal; make about 3,000 tons of ashes, which are used in our brickyards. Part of the excrements of our workpeople are deposited in the closets and utilized for manure; and the remainder passes through the sewers into the river. Have no suggestions to offer. At a branch works, in St. Philipâs Marsh, we recover the sulphur from all our black ash waste and produce from 2 to 2.5 tons of sulphur per week under Mondâs process, and use from 8 to 10 tons of mariticide acid per week there.",

Obtain supply of water from the canal, wells, and bore-holes, and from waterworks company, and consume yearly about 60,000,000 gallons. Use and produce yearly at our works common salt 500 tons, lime 500 tons, oxide of manganese 2,000 tons, and 2,500 tons, tallow 1,059 tons, grease 174 tons, oil 484 tons, resin 261 tons, soap 3,200 tons, and candles 600 tons. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows into depositing tanks, then into the sewers, and thence into the stream. Use steam, 30 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 4,000 tons of coal; the ashes from which are deposited upon rubbish heaps. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by sewers into the river. We suggest as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that the whole of the sewage of the city, instead of being discharged into the stream, should be taken to the mouth of the river and there utilized by irrigation, as there is plenty of waste ground suitable for that purpose.",

The bed of the stream has not silted up to any considerable extent owing to frequent dredgings by the men employed by the dock company. My works are not affected by floods. The condition of the river has not changed within my recollection (extending back about 50 years). The course of the Avon here was converted into a floating harbour, about 1805. The river is polluted by works above; not by mines. Obtain supply of water partly from the river, and from waterworks; but am not able to give the annual consumption at my works. Use yearly, tallow 86 tons, grease 4 tons; palm oil 14 tons; and soap 8 tons; resin 3 tons; bi-chrome 224 lbs.; spirits of salt 840 lbs.; oxide of manganese 560 lbs.; oil of vitriol 2,800 lbs.; and produce soap 51 tons, and candles 57 tons. The waste from the steam tallow melting is run down into a receiver and allowed to settle, and the surface is skimmed to guard against waste, and the deposit taken out and sold. The liquid remaining (being a very dilute acid) flows down the river into the river. The same remark applies to the quantity of liquid run off in sale for soap making. In both cases the quantity of liquid run off is taken away by barge. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed by sewers into the river. Have no suggestions to offer.",

Our works are not affected by floods. The condition of the river has not changed within our knowledge. It is polluted by sewage of Bath and other towns above on the river and tributaries, but not by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the waterworks company, the canal, and from wells. Tan yearly, 35,000 hides. Do not use any pigeons', fowls', or dogs' dung. The whole of the hair obtained in depilation, and the fatty matter obtained in fleshing, is sold to glue makers. We have at our tanyards 62 tan-pits of various sizes. Do not use any dye wares. The whole of the coal used at our works flows into sewers, and thence into the stream. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly about 1,000 tons of coal, the ashes from which are taken away by farmers and manure manufacturers. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed into sewers, and thence into the stream. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that sewage and other liquid refuse should be intercepted, and prevented- from flowing into the river, and should be conveyed to some, distance from the city on to some waste lands near to the mouth of the river to be used for irrigation. Four applications were made to this firm for complete answers to the queries sent, and in reply to the last application the following letter was received:âÃÃ® Avonside Tannery, Bristol, 31st August 1871: Sir,\nWe beg respectfully to decline giving you any further information as to the quantities of the different materials used at these works further than that contained in our letter of March 3rd. We object to sending anything like a false statement, and we very much doubt if any tanner in the locality will send you a true one, if the details are given.",

The bed of the river has silted up, caused by liquid and solid refuse thrown into it, and by a weir formed below for the purpose of giving power to mills. My works are affected by floods, but not so much as formerly. The stream was formerly clear, and there was a plentiful supply of trout; it is now in a very foul condition, especially so in summer, owing to pollutions from various sources above. It is not polluted within my knowledge by mines. Obtain supply of water partly from the stream, but chiefly from wells. If the river were rendered clear and colourless, it would be of very considerable value to me, because the water is softer than the water obtained from wells. Tan yearly, hides 275 tons, and produce yearly, leather 150 tons. Use yearly, lime 73 tons, bark 100 tons, and valonia 330 tons. Do not use any pigeons', fowls', or dogs' dung, bullock's blood, or human excrement. The whole of the hair obtained in the process of depilation and the fatty matter obtained in fleshing is sold to glue makers.

            "reply": "My tanyard is situated on the Frome, an affluent of the Lower Avon, a tributary of the Severn. Employ 10 hands. Rateable value of tanyard, Â£66. The bed of the stream has silted up, caused by liquid and solid refuse thrown into it, and by long neglect. My tanyard is affected by floods, more especially in the last few years; partly owing to the silting up of the bed of the river, but partly owing to the arching over of a portion of the river near the centre of the city, and so confining the watercourse. I have been a resident in this locality all my life (48 years) and connected as assistant manager of these works for years. I recollect the stream being pure enough for all manufacturing purposes, but for many years it has been so polluted by sewage and drainage as to be unfit for manufacturing purposes, and is most pestilential during the summer months; it is not polluted to my knowledge by mines. Do not obtain a supply of water from the river, because it is so polluted, nor from two wells sunk expressly on our premises, which have been contaminated by the water of the river infiltrating into them; but obtain supply of water from waterworks, and could consume yearly 320,000 gallons. If the river, from which I might derive a supply of water, were rendered clear and colourless, it would be a direct money value to me of 20l. a year. Tan yearly, hides 50 tons, and produce yearly, leather 20 tons. Use yearly, lime 1 ton, bark 100 tons, shuma 1 ton, and pigeonsâ dung 5 bushels. Do not use dye stuff, dung, bullocksâ blood, or human excrement. Obtain yearly 250 bushels of hair in the process of depilation. Obtain yearly 6 tons of fleshings, which are sold to glue makers. Have 5 tanpits, 9 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet deep; 5 - 6 feet by 5 feet 2, and 5 feet 6 deep; 36 - 5 feet 3 by 3 feet, and 5 feet deep; also 5 limpetts 10 feet by 3 feet 6 by 5 feet deep; and 1 - 4 feet by 3 feet, and 1 feet deep. Do not use any dye wares. Produce yearly 150,000 gallons of liquid refuse, chiefly spent tan liquor and lime water, which flow direct into the river, as the authorities will not allow us to turn them into the sewers. The spent lime deposited at the bottom of the pits is carried away afterwards for manure. Do not use steam as power. Consume yearly 24 tons of coal, the ashes of which are carted away for manure. The excrements of my workpeople are conveyed by public sewers into the river. I suggest that the best means of avoiding pollution of rivers in future would be the completion of the system of side or intercepting sewers, which system was commenced by the Bristol Board of Health in or about 1853, but has only been partially carried out, and from which plan, though of great cost to us in the shape of rates, we have received no benefit. The rapid growth of the suburbs of the city and villages, nearly 1,000 houses being built before any proper system of drainage is provided, such an immense quantity of sewage and drainage has poured into the river as to pollute it to a great extent. This is an increasing evil, which ought to be checked. A great deal can be done by cleaning out and improving the bed of the river for some years.",

The whole of the waste liquid produced at our works flows into the river. Do not use any dye wares or bleaching materials. Use yearly 4 tons of olive oil of the value of 1921. The whole of the waste wool produced in the process of carding is sold to shoddy merchants. Use yearly, soap 4 tons, and urine 4,500 gallons. The soapsuds are not treated for the recovery of the grease, but flow direct into the river. Use 16 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 400 tons of coal, the ashes from which are sold for building purposes. The whole of the excrements of our workpeople are conveyed into the river. No suggestions to offer.",

The bed of the river has silted up, caused by solid and liquid refuse thrown into it. Our works are occasionally affected by known it. The refuse from slaughter-houses within the last three years has been turned into the stream, as also the sewage of the town, and solid and liquid refuse from manufacturers, and the stench, especially in the summer time, is most horrible. It is not polluted within our knowledge by mines. Obtain supply of water jointly from the river and from wells; but cannot state the annual consumption at our works. We should very much prefer to have clean water, if it could be got from the river, but we make our present supply serve our purpose. Manufacture yearly goods of the value of 12,000l. The whole of the liquid refuse produced at our works flows direct into the river. Use yearly 20 tons of dye wares, chiefly logwood and barwood, also 4 tons, and salts of salt 600 lbs. Do not use any bleaching materials. Use yearly 3 tons of Gallipoli oil of the value of 20l. Produce yearly about 3 tons of waste wool in the process of cleaning, which is sold. Use yearly soap 3 tons, and an unknown quantity of urine. The soapsuds are conveyed to grease extracting works near, but we gain nothing by the recovery of the grease. Use steam, 20 nominal horse-power. Consume yearly 480 tons of coal, the ashes from which are either for manure or for mixing with lime for mortar. The excrements of our workpeople are conveyed into the river. We suggest, as the best means of avoiding pollution in future, that the sewage and other liquid refuse should be conveyed on to suitable land, and utilized, instead of being turned into rivers and streams.",
